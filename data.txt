I\u2019d been part of the <a href=\"http://www.clevelandplayhouse.com/\">Cleveland Play House</a>\u2019s first children\u2019s group, <a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2011/05/curtain_pullers_set_the_stage.html\">along with Paul Newman and Joel Grey</a>. Shirley Temple was famous and mothers all wanted their daughters to be stars.</p> <p>One weekend, two friends making a documentary told me they were driving to New Jersey to interview Albert Einstein, hoping he\u2019d say something against nuclear bombs. This was not long after Hiroshima. On the way, they gave me a 35mm camera and told me to take pictures while they filmed. I\u2019d no idea what I was doing. I\u2019d never used a 35mm before so they had to give me a quick lesson in the back of the car. </p> <p>Einstein was wonderful. He came to the door in baggy tracksuit trousers and sweatshirt. He was so at ease he made us all feel relaxed, too. My friends filmed and I took pictures. Afterwards, I handed over the film, they sent me a couple of prints, and I didn\u2019t think much more of it. The pictures appear grainy but they really capture the atmosphere that day in Einstein\u2019s lounge, as he spoke out strongly against atomic weapons.</p> <p>A few months later, I went to Paris with a friend and worked as a singer at Chez Carr\u00e8re, an exclusive dining club off the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/dec/18/edith-piaf-at-100-the-singer-who-defined-parisian-courage\">Edith Piaf</a> would arrive with her huge entourage, which included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/19/charles-aznavour-i-wanted-to-break-every-taboo\">Charles Aznavour</a>, and we\u2019d all go back to her house in the Bois de Boulogne for breakfast.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/apr/29/the-chic-and-the-shabby-paris-in-the-1950s-by-marilyn-stafford\">The chic and the shabby: Paris in the 1950s by Marilyn Stafford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a fantastic time to be in Paris. I met so many people. One evening at Chez Carr\u00e8re I was invited to join Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s table. Another time, Bing Crosby asked me to the races at Longchamp. It was the start of a great friendship.</p> <p>I\u2019d take a camera with me everywhere and do \u201chappy snaps\u201d, but even then it didn\u2019t cross my mind to become a professional photographer until I lost my voice and realised I couldn\u2019t go on singing. I hinted to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/robert-capa\">Robert Capa</a>, who I\u2019d been introduced to with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/20/henri-cartier-bresson-exhibition-pompidou-centre-communist\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>, that I\u2019d love to try my hand. I was a bit shy about asking: they were gods. Capa suggested I do some war photography. </p> <p>I really didn\u2019t want to go to war, though. So, at Cartier-Bresson\u2019s suggestion, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/apr/29/the-chic-and-the-shabby-paris-in-the-1950s-by-marilyn-stafford\">I began taking pictures in the streets</a>. I discovered a slum near the Bastille and took a lot of photos there and also did some fashion work. I wasn\u2019t much interested in the clothes but I loved taking the models out into the streets. That simply wasn\u2019t done back then.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had a wonderful life and have wonderful memories. These days, I want to help other young female photographers, which is why I started the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fotodocument.org/fotoreportage-award/\">Marilyn Stafford FotoReportage award</a>. There were only 10 female photographers on Fleet Street when I came to England and, although there are more now, the balance is still unequal.</p> <p>This was the very first picture I ever took. So it was quite by accident, and thanks to Albert Einstein, that I became a photographer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"993ad889f805d165480940fc47b6479ce8bf0d9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/993ad889f805d165480940fc47b6479ce8bf0d9f/970_220_1490_1490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn Stafford in Paris in the 1950s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marilyn Stafford in Paris in the 1950s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Fenn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Marilyn Stafford\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>1925 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.</p> <p><strong>Trained</strong><strong>:</strong> Mentored by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa.</p> <p><strong>Influences</strong><strong>:</strong> Dust bowl photographs by Dorothea Lange; the work of Cartier-Bresson and Capa; Life magazine.</p> <p><strong>Low point</strong><strong>:</strong> \u201cThe imbalance of women to men in documentary photography.\u201d</p> <p><strong>High points</strong><strong>:</strong> \u201cMy first front page in 1958 with Algerian refugees; and meeting Albert Einstein.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Top tip:</strong> \u201cLearn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>One of the advertising world\u2019s most celebrated contrarians, Sir John Hegarty is still railing against conformity after more than 50 years at the forefront of the industry. The co-founder of ad agency <a href=\"http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/\">BBH</a> and creator of acclaimed campaigns for brands such as Levi\u2019s, Audi, BA and Johnnie Walker, Hegarty believes that the propensity for groupthink in the modern workplace can kill off creativity. </p> <p>\u201cNo great idea has ever come out of a brainstorm meeting,\u201d Hegarty says. The trouble with brainstorms, he believes, is that they operate at \u201cthe speed of the slowest person in the room\u201d. \u201cEinstein didn\u2019t work in a brainstorm session,\u201d he adds. He sees parallels between brainstorming and communism. \u201cGermany got the BMW, while East Germany got brainstorm sessions and the Trabant. Who wants a fucking Trabant?\u201d</p> <p>Hegarty, who runs a startup incubator the <a href=\"http://www.thegaragesoho.london/\">The Garage Soho</a>, was speaking at an event hosted by the Guardian Small Business Network at <a href=\"http://sohoworks.com/\">Soho Works</a>, a co-working space in Shoreditch, London. <br /></p> <p>As guest speaker at the event he explained his approach to creativity \u2013 which he defines as \u201can expression of self\u201d. He told the audience: \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re designing packs for Tesco or you\u2019re making a movie, what you do, your creativity, is an expression of you.\u201d</p> <p>Hegarty has made a career out of challenging conventions. His first ad campaign for Levi\u2019s, launched in 1982 the year he co-founded BBH, showed a black sheep among a herd of white sheep moving in the other direction with the tagline \u201cwhen the world zigs, zag\u201d \u2013 words which went on to become the agency\u2019s mantra. Hegarty was behind Levi\u2019s most famous TV ads, including commercials featuring model <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q56M5OZS1A8\">Nick Kamen</a> and the head-banging yellow puppet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLlKYF2L0d8\">Flat Eric</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paul McCartney breaks up with John Lennon and ends up writing the fucking frog song</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His advice to anyone wanting a long and successful creative career is to pay more attention to the world around them. \u201cIf you\u2019re a creative person, remove the headphones,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re listening to the latest tracks as you walk down the road and think you look cool ... All these ideas are coming into you all the time, if you cut yourself off you are reducing and limiting your ability to survive.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Spending your time staring at a screen won\u2019t help either. \u201cEverybody else is looking at a computer screen,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do things other people aren\u2019t doing.\u201d Hegarty is also not a fan of the beanbag chairs that are often a feature of workspaces in the creative industries. \u201cThe last place anybody is going to have an idea is sitting on a beanbag. You\u2019ll fall asleep on a beanbag.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He warns that cynicism will crush creative ambition, saying that everyone, from novelists to fashion designers, needs to believe in what they are doing. \u201cGreat creative people are optimists,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Another way to prolong your career is to surround yourself with people who are unafraid to disagree with you, no matter how successful you get. \u201cYou become distanced from the people you can really count on because that is what success does,\u201d he says. Hegarty calls this \u201cMcCartney syndrome\u201d. \u201cPaul McCartney wrote some of the greatest songs. Then he breaks up with John Lennon and ends up writing the fucking frog song. He didn\u2019t have Lennon saying to him \u2018Hey Paul ... that\u2019s shite\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>After running BBH for over 30 years, Hegarty has turned his attention to the next generation of entrepreneurs with the incubator for seed stage companies he co-founded alongside venture capitalist Tom Teichman in 2014. The startups backed by The Garage include the online mattress retailer <a href=\"https://simbasleep.com/?gclid=CKje15qFuNQCFQEA0wodME0C-w\">Simba</a> and property technology business <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.settled.co.uk/\">Settled</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter how great your idea is, within no time at all somebody will have copied it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hegarty says he and his team look for startups that disrupt a current model and offer a product or service that makes life easier. \u201cThere are core principles if you\u2019re thinking of setting up a business. Is it going to disrupt a current market, is it scalable and is it monetisable?,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of people who come to us with a great idea and we ask them how do you make money out of that, and they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>The Garage\u2019s motto is \u201cdon\u2019t start a business, build a brand\u201d. He explains: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how great your idea is or how brilliant the technology, within no time at all somebody will have copied it ... What you\u2019ve got to do is build an interesting brand because a brand will protect you from competitive pressure.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In his talk, Hegarty championed the importance of the idea and its power to change the world, saying: \u201cAnybody can have an idea, you don\u2019t need special equipment or special training or special permission, unless you live in North Korea.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Answering an audience member\u2019s question on the challenges facing traditional advertising agencies in the digital age, he said: \u201cI hear people in advertising saying there\u2019s no point because nobody\u2019s watching ads any more \u2013 that\u2019s just stupid. </p> <p>\u201cArchitects haven\u2019t gone \u2018Jesus, it\u2019s too difficult to put up interesting buildings any more so let\u2019s give up\u2019 ...

Did he worry about falling into the traditional biopic trap of signposting the big moments? \u201cThe thing about Einstein is that his life story doesn\u2019t really fit into a movie narrative,\u201d says Howard. \u201cTelevision allows us to take risks with the structure of the story by telling it in a nonlinear way. That shifting between the experiences of the older Einstein and the younger was really important to us \u2013 it lets people know that we weren\u2019t trying to approach his life in a conventional or particularly safe way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0789a91a04a591fc8d89cc917f72d675d060639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0789a91a04a591fc8d89cc917f72d675d060639/141_130_1825_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Einstein and his second wife Elsa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Einstein and his second wife Elsa in 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rush agrees: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a story with Eureka! moments,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many little corners to this guy\u2019s life and those are what the series is most interested to explore.\u201d</p> <p>Most of all it\u2019s a series about personality. Isaacson\u2019s book memorably describes Einstein as \u201ca loner with an intimate bond to humanity, a rebel who was suffused with reverence\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a description with which Flynn agrees. \u201cWhen I read Isaacson\u2019s book what struck me was his rebelliousness. He went to university off his own back because his father\u2019s not really supporting and he\u2019s proud in his identity,\u201d he says. \u201cHe really knows who he is. At that stage in his university career he\u2019s very charismatic \u2013 he\u2019s more like [French poet] Rimbaud.\u201d</p> <p>Howard was also keen not to ignore the darker aspects of the scientist\u2019s life: his failed first marriage, his issues with fidelity, the guilt he felt about surviving war when countless others didn\u2019t, his complicated relationship with Judaism, his conflicted feelings over the development of the atomic bomb. The series is particularly good about Einstein\u2019s relationships with his two wives: scientist Mileva Mari\u0107 (played by Samantha Colley) whom he loved intensely but divorced in 1919, and Elsa (Emily Watson), his first cousin who appeared happy to play second fiddle to a genius, bolstering his ideas and helping to build his celebrity.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t shy away from the complexities of the relationship between Einstein and Mileva and how much she contributed to his early career,\u201d says Colley. \u201cShe had such courage and determination and was a trailblazer for female education and a great scientist in her own right. Yet she ends up keeping house and becoming a mother and it\u2019s sort of a death by a thousand cuts.</p> <p>\u201cThe debates about how much she contributed to Albert\u2019s work are particularly interesting because even now women are too often sidelined and don\u2019t push for the credit they deserve.\u201d</p> <p>Mari\u0107\u2019s sad trajectory from celebrated trailblazer to depressed housewife isn\u2019t the only part of the Einstein story that the makers believe will strike a chord with modern viewers. \u201cHe\u2019s living in a time when the world is moving to the right and totalitarianism is on the rise and global conflict is looming within another generation. It does resonate, absolutely,\u201d says Rush.</p> <p>Howard agrees. \u201cWhen you think how close he came to not sharing his gifts with the world because of his religion, the politics of the time, the narrow-minded institutional thinking, the nationalism \u2026 it\u2019s troubling that decades later those themes still feel so relevant.\u201d</p> <p>So too does Einstein\u2019s celebrity status in later life, a celebrity that the scientist found thrust upon him rather than embracing. \u201cThere is this whole theme about how do you cope with becoming a\u00a0celebrity, with being world famous and\u00a0as much of a household name as\u00a0Charlie Chaplin but you\u2019re a theoretical scientist,\u201d says Rush. \u201cStephen Hawking today is probably the closest example.\u201d</p> <p>National Geographic has conceived <em>Genius</em> as an anthology series with a new \u201cgenius\u201d in the spotlight each season. Do they have an idea of who will be next? \u201cWe\u2019re narrowing it down,\u201d says Howard. \u201cWhat made Einstein so perfect was that his life has so many surprises that allowed for a dramatically compelling and watchable tale.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I can say is we are looking for subjects where we can offer something fresh in the telling. We won\u2019t always go for the most obvious choice.\u201d</p> <p><em>Genius: Albert Einstein begins on National Geographic at 9pm on 23 April</em></p>",

A man celebrated for his extraordinary mind is busy stimulating a different part of his body: his pants are around his ankles and, in the throes of passion, his lover Betty (Charity Wakefield) is pressed against a blackboard strewn with chalk-drawn calculations. </p> <p>Wowza. I wasn\u2019t expecting Einstein After Dark. It\u2019s a racy introduction to another, perhaps predictably excellent performance from Rush, who since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2013/dec/27/shine-rewatching-classic-australian-films\">his breakthrough in 1996\u2019s Shine</a> as the tormented pianist David Helfgott, has been attracted to eccentric genius characters like a moth to the light. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/15/albert-einstein-genius-hidden-sides-national-geographic-drama-geoffrey-rush-emily-watson\">Dreamer, rebel, lover: the hidden sides of Albert Einstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this moment is intended to slow the pace down, not speed it up. It is positively tame compared with the scene prior, in which gun-toting fascists murder innocents then throw a high-powered explosive in their car, prompting a spectacular <em>kablammo! </em>aerial shot. <br /></p> <p>The director of the first episode, Ron Howard (also a co-developer), then zooms into a closeup of a newspaper on the back seat of the burning vehicle. This shot continues unbroken; next thing we know Betty\u2019s hand is pressed against it and we hear moaning and panting. Howard has transitioned to the next scene \u2013 the site of Einstein with his pants down \u2013 without cutting. <br /></p> <p>What an intro! And they say pedagogical treatments and intertidal systems are only for squares. For a moment I wondered whether Genius was actually inspired by its subject\u2019s life and work, or instead that famous photograph of him sticking his tongue out \u2013 the National Geographic audience punk\u2019d into thinking this was going to be about, you know, science and stuff. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26407bfb24dae7f6657e4b61cca1d171721bd3d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26407bfb24dae7f6657e4b61cca1d171721bd3d7/0_0_800_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Watson\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Watson plays Elsa Einstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dusan Martincek/National Geographic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It doesn\u2019t take long before the star of the show starts lecturing people, a habit he maintains throughout the running time, with various audiences and in various scenarios. Betty is the first to cop it. Einstein hectors her about having \u201cblind faith in authority\u201d when she rejects his proposal to move in with her on the hardly unreasonable grounds they would have to share the house with Albert\u2019s second wife Elsa (Emily Watson). <br /></p> <p>\u201cFor a man who is an expert on the universe you don\u2019t know the first thing about people, do you?\u201d she fires back. That line suggests some rather on-the-nose drama is in store, but thankfully Howard and his team mostly resist lazy or hackneyed storytelling \u2013 notwithstanding a few similarly histrionic contrivances in the dialogue. Genius is a sassy, robust ride: whiplash-smart and littered with imaginative visual connections such as the aforementioned single-shot transition. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"925c414ce5e83a45b86a81b12d523f4dbde3e995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925c414ce5e83a45b86a81b12d523f4dbde3e995/0_0_800_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"Shannon Tarbet as Marie Winteler and Johnny Flynn as young Albert Einstein\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Tarbet as Marie Winteler and Johnny Flynn as young Albert Einstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/National Geographic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Rush\u2019s frizzy-haired mug is the face stamped across the marketing images, but leading-man status is shared with the British actor Johnny Flynn. Flynn holds his own against the Oscar winner as a younger, university-enrolled Einstein finding his way through life, butting heads against stuffy academics and protesting entrenched ways of thinking. In the Geoffrey Rush, 1922-onwards timeline, the rise of Nazism bubbles in the background, occasionally boiling over into heated confrontation.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/18/hugo-weaving-on-revisiting-the-matrix-they-would-start-again-with-different-actors\">Hugo Weaving on revisiting The Matrix: 'They would start again with different actors'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second episode, directed by Minkie Spiro (Call the Midwife, Downton Abbey) focuses on Einstein\u2019s relationship with a fellow student \u2013 and future first wife \u2013 Mileva Maric (Samantha Cooley), at the Zurich Polytechnic Institute. Spiro and the screenwriters not only give her real agency (boosted by a prickly, scenery-chewing performance from Cooley) but frame the episode from Maric\u2019s perspective, with flashbacks depicting her struggles against the patriarchy. </p> <p>In doing so, the Geoffrey Rush timeline is removed from episode two. It\u2019s a bold move, lending Genius\u2019 structure an erratic quality at the point most shows want to find a steady pace and settle in for the long haul. The first two episodes form the extent of this review; no doubt Rush will return \u2013 pants on or off \u2013 in subsequent offerings. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Genius is showing on National Geographic, Mondays at 8.30pm from 24 April</em></p>",

          "body": "<p>Some university professors have always made it their mission to keep their students out of the pub. Professor Eugene Terentjev, head of science at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, last week provided a spectacular example of this impulse, in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-41899293\" title=\"\">a note sent to his new intake of undergraduates</a> who, he had observed, like a drink.</p> <p>Professor Terentjev\u2019s letter ran as follows: \u201cPlease be careful how you handle yourselves here; remember you are NOT at any other uni, where students do drink a lot and do have what they regard as a \u2018good time\u2019 \u2013 and you are NOT on a course, as some Cambridge courses sadly are, where such a behaviour pattern is possible or acceptable. Physical sciences is a VERY hard subject, which will require ALL of your attention and your FULL brain capacity (and for a large fraction of you even that will not be quite enough)\u2026 People who just TAKE the course, but enjoy their social life, can easily survive in many subjects, but not in this one\u2026\u201d</p> <p>No doubt Professor Terentjev\u2019s intent with all those admonishing capital letters was to inspire his students to a path of righteousness: a social life was for losers. Not surprisingly, however, his welcome note proved distinctly unwelcome to many. A spokesperson for the Cambridge branch of Student Minds, a mental health charity, argued that the message would encourage \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d, that sense among students that they were not worthy of a place, with all its damaging psychological consequences. Again, not surprisingly, some commentators, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5060169/Fury-Cambridge-don-tells-students-stop-drinking.html\" title=\"\">notably in the <em>Daily Mail</em></a>, saw this latter response as further evidence of seditious \u201csnowflake\u201d tendencies within our universities. \u201cSurely students are there to work?\u201d the outrage ran.</p> <p>Charitably, you could argue that Professor Terentjev\u2019s message showed an underlying concern about his students\u2019 welfare: heavy drinking was probably at least as likely to undermine their mental health as overwork. But in other ways, for a man of science, his analysis sounded curiously flawed.</p> <p>For a start, the impression he gave that such behaviour is on the increase goes against both the grape and grain of wider data. One of the more striking findings in the Office for National Statistics <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/bulletins/opinionsandlifestylesurveyadultdrinkinghabitsingreatbritain/2005to2016#main-points\" title=\"\">study of British social attitudes</a> published this year was that young adults are much more likely to be teetotal than any older age group. More than a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds do not drink at all, compared with just over a fifth of the broader adult population.</p> <p>I saw some evidence of this myself recently when I was writing a story about freshers\u2019 week at Edge Hill University. Partly because the level of fees had concentrated undergraduate minds, there seemed an unusual earnestness about the new intake. A\u00a0student union president told me her key aim for the introductory week was to have \u201cat least as many non-alcohol as alcohol events\u201d, while a university chancellor offered two observations of a new sobriety. \u201cThe bars are empty and you can\u2019t get a seat in the library,\u201d one student rep had lamented to her, while a cleaner in the halls of residence insisted that students seemed so much more diligent. Her evidence? \u201cThere is no sick in the bins any more.\u201d</p> <p>Another apparent misconception in the professor\u2019s remarks \u2013 that any kind of enjoyable social life would make it impossible to survive his course \u2013 sounded even more wrongheaded. We live in a country <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/which-european-countries-work-the-longest-hours/\" title=\"\">high in European league tables for working hours</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/2015#main-points\" title=\"\">low in terms of productivity</a>. Those habits are often ingrained in an education and exam culture that prioritises grind over balance. <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/\" title=\"\">Bertrand Russell\u2019s famous contention</a> that human brains are capable of no more than four hours a day of serious concentration, and that the rest is best spent idling, is borne out in much of the recent science.</p> <p>Recent studies of work suggest that all <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96c85ab8-77fc-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7\" title=\"\">productivity declines sharply after 50 hours a week</a> and that the most <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-downtime/\" title=\"\">productive brains need about 20 minutes of inactivity</a> for every useful hour. Crucially, the longitudinal studies show that the single key component of an engaged and productive life is the ability to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3051290/why-having-friends-at-work-is-so-important\" title=\"\">forge and maintain strong friendship groups</a>. Everything else flows from that. Professor Terentjev appears to propose, rather sniffily, that the discipline he teaches is uniquely immune from such findings. There are plenty of scientific minds who would beg to differ.</p> <p>I spoke recently to Professor Carlo Rovelli, groundbreaking theorist of quantum gravity. His book, <em>Seven Brief Lessons of Physics</em>, begins with an account of Albert Einstein, mostly idling and loafing through his teens and early 20s, before his great work began. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anywhere by not \u2018wasting\u2019 time,\u201d Rovelli proposed. I wondered how much he thought that principle essential to scientific practice?</p> <p>\u201cLeaps of knowledge are made when one steps back, and forgets, and explores different things,\u201d he said. In his own life, Rovelli had come to concentrated study in physics only after \u201cbeing a very bad student\u201d travelling, drinking, involving himself in politics, starting a radio station. It is often only through a broad and sociable experience, he argued, that you can find the resolve and opportunity to focus on what Terentjev would call VERY HARD problems. Somewhat sadly, Rovelli suggested, such a life was increasingly impossible in academia.</p> <p>There are plenty of other examples. The one that sticks in my mind is an afternoon I spent at Manchester University with one of the Nobel prize-winning discoverers of graphene, Kostya\u00a0Novoselov. For all the intensive hours of research that led to the discovery of the magical one-atom thick material, the real breakthrough he insisted, with a laugh, had come in a playful after-hours discussion, with a beer or two, and the idea to use a roll of Scotch tape to harvest the material.</p> <p>If Professor Terentjev really believes his own university is different in kind to any other, he could also look a hundred yards up the road. The most significant Cambridge eureka moment of the last century was first announced not in a lab or a journal but in the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804545.stm\" title=\"\">Eagle pub one lunchtime</a>, by Francis Crick and James Watson, both regulars there.</p> <p>All the evidence suggests that, in the healthy brain, recreation makes concentration possible. Is it possible or useful to instruct our minds to be intensely curious about one thing and not about every other thing? The science suggests not.</p>",

Survival of the fittest means all humans live with degrees of anxiety \u2013 including the kind that can cause impostor syndrome.</p> <p>Second, your culture will also have an effect. As a coach, I have noticed that British clients are less inclined to own success for fear of being labelled arrogant, compared with Americans. Women and people from minority populations also experience impostor syndrome more, due to cultural inequities.</p> <p>Third, as children our emotional need to belong often leads us to downplay our abilities as a survival strategy, believing we are more acceptable when we fit in rather than stand out. This can linger into adulthood where it harms rather than helps us. But while we may not be sole authors of our anxious tendencies, we do have responsibility to do something about it so that we can serve ourselves and the world better.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Have the courage to be imperfect</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next time you fear being exposed as a fraud, name it for what it is \u2013 impostor syndrome. Notice the cascade of bodily sensations and automatic thoughts. Perhaps your stomach flips or heart pounds. What are the scripts that your mind starts running? They will be the same ones again and again, which makes them easier to spot: \u201cI\u2019m useless and people will know\u201d, for instance. Remind yourself that this is not reality, just your perception of it. To name impostor syndrome is to start to sense control over it and recognise that it is a complex condition that you can \u2013 with practise \u2013 overcome.</p> <p>Give each inner script a character so you can recognise who is speaking when they pipe up: \u201cthe judge\u201d or \u201cthe perfectionist\u201d, for instance. They are mechanisms of your subconscious running the same program as when you were a child, working to keep you in your comfort zone where you feel you can manage and be accepted. They often show up when you are taking on more responsibility, challenges and risks.</p> <p>Talk back to them, thank them for services rendered and instruct them that they are surplus to requirements. In parallel, tone up your connection to your inner allies: the inner psychological sub-personalities of your brain\u2019s executive function who encourage and coach you. Name them too: \u201cthe sage\u201d or \u201cthe inner leader\u201d. Though it might feel odd, you are externalising your negative thoughts and tapping into your inner wisdom, clarity, courage and compassion.</p> <p>Have the courage to be imperfect. Our increasing impatience with ourselves seriously depletes our ability to recognise that we are works-in-progress, moving along learning curves all the time. We tend to freeze the frame when we feel nervous, make a mistake or have to sweat to achieve something, and then we damn ourselves for not being up to the job.</p> <p>Finally, take some time to clarify your values. When you know what you stand for, you know what you uniquely have to offer so you won\u2019t pretend you are something you are not, just to get along. Impostor syndrome can be a gift if you use it to create more helpful, mindful, less toxically stressful ways of living. When people share with others who know how they feel, the sense of isolation and shame falls away, and self-awareness, connection and empathy grow. Then we can step forward.</p> <p>\u2022 Fiona Buckland is giving a Guardian Masterclass on 10 October on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2017/jan/20/how-to-tackle-impostor-syndrome\" title=\"\">how to tackle impostor syndrome and embrace your power</a></p>",

Although he breezes through Einstein\u2019s whole life, including his annus mirabilis, 1905, when aged 26 he\u00a0wrote five papers that transformed physics, the main focus is on the later years. Einstein was furious with himself for changing his 1915 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/jun/23/the-genesis-and-renaissance-of-general-relativity\" title=\"\">theory of general relativity</a> to bring it\u00a0in\u00a0line with current but misleading astronomical observations, a mistake he had to rectify in 1931. It was, he said,\u00a0\u201cthe greatest blunder of\u00a0my life\u201d. Bodanis argues that he increasingly distrusted new experimental data. His insistence \u201cthat all underlying reality was clear, exact, understandable\u201d meant that he refused to accept growing evidence of the fundamental unknowability of the universe as revealed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists\" title=\"\">quantum mechanics</a>. \u201cUnreasonable stubbornness\u201d characterised Einstein\u2019s final two\u00a0decades, a tragic waste of a great intellect.

          "body": "<p>At the Dolli Einstein Haus, constitutional crises are usually solved before breakfast. When one delegate\u2019s motion in favour of rice pudding with cherry compote was roundly defeated the delegates were left facing a hung vote over the choice of french toast or pancake with apple puree. Another council member then demanded sausages with spaghetti. But a second-round runoff broke the deadlock: 12:4 in favour of pancakes, an absolute majority that everyone could live with.</p> <p>At most nurseries, parents worry that their child will pick up nits, a runny nose or bad language. At the Dolli Einstein Haus in Pinneberg, however, parents hope that their offspring catch a different kind of habit: a taste for democracy.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The nursery, which was certified as Germany\u2019s first \u201cdemocracy nursery\u201d earlier this year, is run on a mission to test how far decision-making processes can be devolved to the under-sixes, by giving children a vote on anything from breakfast menus to nappy changing.</p> <p>Three and a half years into their experiment, the brains behind the project are not only discovering that democratic ideas remain surprisingly contagious even in an era of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/26/populism-is-the-result-of-global-economic-failure\">populist revivals</a>, but that the compromises required are often more challenging for adults than children.<br /></p> <p>Educators at the daycare centre in northern Germany tell the story of six-year-old Pia, who recently objected to her parents telling her to go to sleep by citing the kindergarten\u2019s \u201cconstitution\u201d, which is prominently displayed in each playroom: \u201cI can decide when I go to bed. It\u2019s my right.\u201d</p> <p>The centre\u2019s charter lists seven basic rights: I have the right to sleep; I decide what and how much I eat; I decide what I play with; I decide where I sit; I am allowed to voice my opinion any time; I decide who I want to cuddle with; and I decide who changes my nappies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9f236be0dae236a066b0dc47ed2cbb93495525d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9f236be0dae236a066b0dc47ed2cbb93495525d/0_0_2823_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The kindergarten\u2019s constitution\" width=\"1000\" height=\"826\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kindergarten\u2019s constitution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selim Sudheimer/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the nursery head, Ute Rodenwald, and her deputy, Heike Schl\u00fcter, are quick to reject being bracketed with the non-conformist educational models associated with Germany\u2019s 1968 student movement \u2013 the word \u201canti-authoritarian\u201d elicits howls of denial.</p> <p>\u201cAnti-authoritarian education assumes that any group of children will in mysterious ways learn to regulate and structure itself,\u201d said Schl\u00fcter. \u201cBut since we\u2019ve had our constitution and children have been involved in the decision-making, we have had more rules than before, not fewer.\u201d</p> <p>Children at the Dolli Einstein Haus may get a say on who changes their nappies, but after several amendments the small print of the centre\u2019s founding document makes clear that the right to decide when a nappy needs changing rests exclusively with the educators.</p> <p>Rodenwald sees her project\u2019s mission less in empowering children than equipping them with the skills to cope with with a rapidly changing modern world: \u201cDemocracy is not just about elections. For us it is about people \u2013 or children \u2013 being taken seriously, and learning to make decisions in a way that doesn\u2019t leave other people behind,\u201d she said. </p> <p>As more and more households are made up of two working parents, Rodenwald argues, the pressure has grown on on preschool establishments to take a more active role in educating young people.</p> <p>Originally conceived by a group of educators in the state of Schleswig-Holstein in 2001, the project only truly clicked into gear after Angela Merkel\u2019s first cabinet voted to <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-coalition-agrees-on-radical-expansion-of-nurseries/a-5214290\">triple the number of day care places for children</a> in 2007. Most children at the Dolli Einstein Haus, which is run by the non-profit charity Workers Welfare Institution and named after a talking bird from a children\u2019s book, are registered from age one and stay there from 8am until 4pm on weekdays. </p> <p>Once a week, each group at the nursery meets for a session at which there are two rounds of votes: one on the topping of the afternoon cake, and one on the Friday morning breakfast menu. The former is essentially a referendum, with the educators for example offering a choice between lemon and chocolate cake, while for the latter the children can nominate four meal options.</p> <p>The options are drawn on pieces of paper which are placed in the middle of a circle of children, each of whom sits down on a cushion after listening to the sound of a quiet gong, facing outwards to allow an anonymous vote. When their names are called, the children take turns placing coloured pebbles, known as <em>Muckelsteine</em>, underneath their preferred option.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93eb16d5fc74c95855ce43f69fe767103b6554c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93eb16d5fc74c95855ce43f69fe767103b6554c8/0_201_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl places her vote for cake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl places her vote for cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selim Sudheimer/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In both votes, the result is strictly first past the post and constitutionally binding. The nursery chef has to act out the will of the voters even if it seems disgusting or unhealthy \u2013 a principle which has tested the resolve of parents and educators alike. In the past, the Dolli Einstein Haus has served up pizza and stewed beef with beetroot for breakfast.</p> <p>Rodenwald and her team argue that the onus is on the adults to learn to accept the children\u2019s decisions, rather than the other way around: \u201cIt\u2019s about creating alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201cOur experience is that children will eventually eat spinach, salad or rye bread if you keep on offering it and they see other children eat it.\u201d</p> <p>Bigger decisions, such as investment in new toys or rule changes in the playground, are made at a monthly children\u2019s council attended by pairs of boys and girls nominated as \u201cpassers on\u201d. At one recent such meeting, delegates took their leaders to task after Rodenwald made the unilateral decision to buy a pair of new tricycles.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt was such a good offer and we knew the kids liked tricycles, so I had just gone for it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the children told us in no uncertain terms that we had not been authorised to make that decision. That was one of those moments where we felt: yes, we are on the right path.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if children are the better democrats, but they are certainly less calculating. They don\u2019t say things just in order to please people.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of the potential power struggles these democratically trained toddlers may cause at home, the head of the programme at the Workers Welfare Institution said she was not aware of any parents who had pulled out of a democracy nursery so far.</p> <p>On the contrary: after seven nurseries were certified in February, a further 12 are to follow by the end of the year. By 2020, the charity wants all of its 58 nurseries in Schleswig-Holstein to be run on a democratic basis.</p>",

          "body": "<p>On the internet, advertising is the industry that dare not speak its\u00a0name. A Facebook post is \u201csuggested\u201d; a\u00a0tweet is \u201cpromoted\u201d \u2013 they are ads. An article or video is \u201cpresented by\u201d or \u201csponsored\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s an ad. Even something as impressive as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHtvDA0W34I\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner\u2019s skydive</a> from the edge of space in 2012 \u2013 that was an ad, paid for by Red Bull. The term \u201ccontent\u201d serves to blur lines \u2013 helpfully, from an advertiser\u2019s point of view \u2013 between what is advertising and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Google\u2019s founders once wrote that any search engine that sold ads would be compromised; now it\u2019s the biggest advertising company on the planet. Your smartphone, media studies professor Mara Einstein says, is fundamentally an ad-delivery device. Advertising is everywhere. And yet, increasingly, we don\u2019t want to see it. We install ad-blockers because webpages are increasingly slowed down by\u00a0waiting for intrusive adverts to be loaded from some distant server, and because we don\u2019t want to be tracked around the internet by shadowy companies that trade our personal data. But who does ad-blocking really hurt? Clue: not the advertisers.</p> <p>Because ad and marketing people have a twin-barrelled new wheeze, as Einstein explains in illuminating detail. There is \u201ccontent marketing\u201d, in which advertisers produce a \u201cviral\u201d video or whatever that admits, only very subtly, that it\u2019s a piece of advertising, and millions of us perform the valuable labour of \u201csharing\u201d it for them. On the other hand, there is \u201cnative advertising\u201d, where news organisations set up internal departments to create adverts for commercial \u201cpartners\u201d that will be displayed on their own websites, with the minimum possible acknowledgment that this is advertising and not editorial. And so lines become increasingly blurred, as Einstein points out: with content marketing, advertisers become publishers (they produce \u201cfilms\u201d not adverts; and they call their offices \u201cnewsrooms\u201d), while with native advertising, publishers become advertisers. It is an arms race of stealth marketing or what Einstein nicely terms \u201cobscured persuasion\u201d.</p> <p>But so what? You and I, of course, are expert consumers of the media, and we can always tell what is an advert and what isn\u2019t. Or so we think. In fact, studies suggest that even confident, online-savvy millennials can\u2019t, most of the time. \u201cContent confusion\u201d is pandemic. More seriously, and for very good reasons \u2013 those annoyingly slow ads, plus an understandable desire to take what is offered to us for free \u2013 most of us are complicit in ushering in a world where media organisations offering fully independent, fearless editorial may one day\u00a0cease to exist. Publishers have to become stealth advertisers because Google and Facebook are hoovering up all the real ad revenue, and the use of ad-blocking is hurting the rest. The \u201copen\u201d, free business model for new media is plainly a bust. We are going to have to start paying for news, Einstein argues, if we want news to continue existing. In any case, as she points out,\u00a0we pay for it already, just not with money but with our personal data \u2013 which, if we thought about it, we might consider markedly more valuable. \u201cIf we are not willing to pay for content, and if we don\u2019t want to consciously interact with advertising,\u201d she warns, \u201cthen the blurring of church and state is the price we are paying.\u201d</p> <p>Einstein\u2019s explanations of all this \u2013 from internet news organisations to TV product placement and even dating sites \u2013 are thoroughly researched, elegantly explained and often alarming, even for readers familiar with most\u00a0of the above facts in the abstract. Apparently, nearly half of Google users cannot distinguish between the ads and what are wholesomely termed the \u201corganic\u201d results; and shadowy data brokers such as Acxiom can come to learn a remarkable amount of personal facts about ordinary internet users. Profiling may be scandalous when the police do it, but it is all the rage online. In the US, if your name sounds African American, you are 25% more likely to be shown an ad that implies you\u2019ve been arrested in the past.</p> <p>I let out a little silent cheer near the end of this book when Einstein suggested that, instead of pulling out your phone in every idle instant, \u201cmaybe you could just be bored\u201d. Like any good polemic, however, <em>Black Ops Advertising</em> does rather overstate the negative case about today\u2019s internet. Along with many others, for example, I\u2019d rather pay for Netflix than watch \u201cfree\u201d broadcast TV interrupted by adverts, even if Netflix is doing its best to datamine my taste in kung-fu movies and technothrillers in order to design some new show that will doubtless be awesome. And, of course, not every piece of \u201ccontent\u201d that we \u201cshare\u201d online is advertising: you wouldn\u2019t know it from Einstein\u2019s book, but there are still quite a lot of regular people writing and drawing funny things just to amuse their friends.</p> <p>And even \u201cliking\u201d a product page on Facebook is hardly a one-way street if you sincerely admire the brand in question. Sure, as Einstein says, \u201cmarketers want to be friends with us so that we will do the work of sharing their content\u201d, and to do so might be volunteering to perform what in the jargon is known as \u201cunsponsored word of mouth\u201d. But I do, in fact, like Rotring, the German manufacturer of mechanical pencils, as well as the Strokes, and I want to know what they\u2019re up to. For such reasons, and whether we like it not, to be a total online refusenik \u2013 in the way Einstein suggests is the only healthy course of activity \u2013 may, these\u00a0days, be to lead less than a full modern life</p>",

Every time astronomers think they are getting close to understanding the universe, mother nature throws them another curveball to contend with.</p> <p>Today\u2019s googly comes from the <a href=\"http://shsuyu.github.io/H0LiCOW/site/\">H0LiCOW collaboration</a> and takes the form of a faster than expected expansion rate for the universe. Based on new observations taken with the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, it confirms that a serious discrepancy lies at the heart of our astronomical understanding.</p> <p>The rate at which the universe is expanding is a fundamental quantity with which to test cosmological theory. It is called the Hubble Constant after Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer who first measured it in 1929.</p> <p>Ways to measure Hubble\u2019s constant fall into two camps: the study of relatively nearby celestial objects, and the study of far distant radiation left over from the origin of the universe. </p> <p>Both methods should give the same expansion rate. The trouble \u2013 as confirmed today \u2013 is that they don\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/mar/21/european-space-agency-astronomy\">Planck's 'almost perfect' universe could point to new physics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem was first seen <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-s-hubble-finds-universe-is-expanding-faster-than-expected\">last June</a>, when another team of astronomers known as the <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/~ariess/Research.htm\">SH0ES project</a>, published a surprisingly high Hubble Constant that conflicted with the value from two spacecraft: NASA\u2019s WMAP and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/mar/21/planck-unveils-earliest-map-of-universe\">ESA\u2019s Planck</a>.<br /></p> <p>WMAP and Planck had calculated relatively slow Hubble Constants from the Universe\u2019s microwave background radiation, which was produced during the split second in which the universe came into existence.<br /></p> <p>At the time, the astronomers were so confident with the spacecraft that they began referring to the era of \u2018precision cosmology\u2019. In their opinion, just about everything was known about the make-up of the universe, with just the astronomical \u2018i\u2019 dotting and \u2019t\u2019 crossing to be done.</p> <p>Today\u2019s results, which are to be published in a series of five papers by the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras\">Royal Astronomical Society</a>, show that there is much more to be done than the fine detail.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ras.org.uk/news-and-press/2946-cosmic-lenses-support-finding-on-faster-than-expected-expansion-of-the-universe\">statement</a> accompanying the results, H0LiCOW team leader Sherry Suyu, <a href=\"https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/\">Technical University Munich</a> Germany said, \u201cThe expansion rate of the Universe is now starting to be measured in different ways with such high precision that actual discrepancies may possibly point towards new physics beyond our current knowledge of the Universe.\u201d</p> <p>The bottom line is that the universe to almost certainly more complex than we thought \u2013 and it\u2019s already byzantine. To explain other puzzling observations, cosmologists have postulated a number of substances that affect the expansion rate.</p> <p>Firstly there is dark energy, which is designed to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Maybe these new observations suggest that it is growing in strength. </p> <p>Secondly, there is dark matter. Despite suspecting its existence for decades now, astronomers and physicists are no closer to detecting a single particle of the stuff. Could it be behaving in a way that affects the expansion?</p> <p>Thirdly, could there be a kind of dark radiation? This would invisibly carry energy around the cosmos, altering the expansion.</p> <p>Fourthly, could there be a problem with Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity? This is the mathematical framework that astronomers use to calculate Hubble\u2019s Constant based on the matter and energy contained in space. If those equations are even slightly off, then we could have everything else right and still be getting the wrong answer.</p> <p>As yet no one knows which is the more likely solution.</p> <p>Today\u2019s results confirm that what started as a niggle has grown into a full-blown problem for cosmology. Put simply, our picture of the universe does not add up and that means there is probably something fundamental we have not yet understood.</p> <p>This is a good thing. The potential for discovery is huge.

          "body": "<p>Most of us know that creativity is not just for artists \u2013 it has always been key to entrepreneurial success. Pushing heretical ideas, having a unique vision, thinking imaginatively and counterintuitively are the very definitions of creativity in business. In a world where a single original idea, like Uber or the Ice Bucket Challenge, can change the world, creative thinking is more valuable than ever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/aug/18/productive-at-work-neuroscientists-advice-multitasking\">Struggling to be productive at work? Take a neuroscientist's advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The big question is how to unlock your own creative potential? Here are a few steps you can take.</p> <h2><strong>Relax and meditate</strong></h2> <p>More brain activity generally means less creativity. Brains exhibiting fast beta waves \u2013 typical of when you\u2019re actively concentrating (such as when you\u2019re at work) \u2013 perform significantly worse on creativity tests than brains exhibiting the slow alpha waves typical of rest or relaxation and even slower theta waves found in meditative states.</p> <p> So to be more creative, ditch the group brainstorming sessions which have been <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1201_1?journalCode=hbas20&amp;\">scientifically proven to be less effective than when people generate ideas alone</a>, partly because of the way such sessions necessarily lead to increased brain activity. Instead, do some yoga or mindful meditation. Listen to nature sounds. Breathe deeply.</p> <h2><strong>Make time for undemanding physical tasks</strong></h2> <p>Creative ideas are unlikely to emerge if your schedule is always busy, goal-directed and involved in conscious, rational problem solving, according to psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Keith Sawyer. They say in the book The Systems Model of Creativity that creative thinking is \u201cfacilitated by periods of idling, leisure, and involvement in activities such as walking, gardening, driving.\u201d</p> <p> Try putting regular activities of this kind, what I call undemanding physical tasks, into your regular working day. Don\u2019t make it too unchallenging like staring at a wall or too absorbing, like reading an article on your phone. Do something requiring simple bodily coordination and low level mental attention, ideally for five to 10 minutes between two to four times a day. This encourages what\u2019s known as \u201cmind wandering\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22941876\">scientifically known to make creative insights more likely</a>.</p> <p> These tasks shouldn\u2019t be considered a \u201cbreak\u201d from work but as an important part of work. Whether you walk, cycle, knit or casually play the violin (as Einstein did), try forgetting about your pressing work challenges and just do the task. Paradoxically, you may well find that a solution to one or other of your problems just pops into your head. </p> <h2><strong>Practise connecting ideas</strong></h2> <p>How do you make a new idea? Try combining some old ones. Einstein said \u201ccombinatory play seems to be the essential component in productive thought\u201d, while as Steve Jobs put it: \u201cCreativity is just connecting things\u201d. In 1974, for example, Art Fry who worked at the manufacturing firm 3M had the brainwave of combining a weak glue the company had previously developed \u2013 which served no apparent function \u2013 with a bookmark he used in church. The result was the Post-It Note.</p> <p> So try to deliberately blend various ideas, images and concepts together. You\u2019re sitting in a caf\u00e9. See your coffee cup? Combine it with your shoe. What do you get? Footwear infused with a natural odour suppressant (coffee). This kind of playful mental experimentation will enhance your brain\u2019s combinatory faculty and may even produce some usable concepts.</p> <h2><strong>Keep a dream diary</strong></h2> <p>Dreams, with their surreal contradictions, are one of our great untapped creative resources. Paul McCartney wrote the song Yesterday after a dream (he heard the tune in the midst of a dream, awoke and reproduced it). In the 1860s, Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev conceived the concept of the periodic table of elements in a dream, and in the 1840s Elias Howe discovered the secret to the modern sewing machine design while dreaming.</p> <p>We all dream for around two hours every night, yet we forget most of them. Starting a daily dream diary (apps such as DreamSphere and Shadow are also available) will help you recall many more of your dreams, which in itself will make more available to your waking brain a more fluid, imaginative style of thinking. And you never know, you might literally dream up a billion dollar idea.</p> <p><em>Dr Michael Bloomfield is founder and director at <a href=\"http://www.creato-online.com/\">Creato</a>, a creative brain training company.</em></p>",

Actually it was more of a filthy den dug deep in the earth. Goldilocks knocked, but when no one answered, she crawled down into the den.</p> <p>On the table in the den, she found three bowls of porridge.</p> <p>No she didn\u2019t. Bears don\u2019t have the fine motor skills to build tables, nor can they cook. And they don\u2019t like porridge. What Goldilocks actually found was the rotting remains of three dead rabbits.</p> <p>But she was very hungry. So she tried one. It was horrible. She tried another. It was no better. The third rabbit was disgusting, so she ate a cheese sandwich instead.</p> <p>Goldilocks felt sleepy. She lay down in the first bed, which was less a bed than a pile of leaves mixed with mud and bear excrement. The second bed was the same. And the third. But Goldilocks was tired, so she fell fast asleep anyway.</p> <p>As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. They did not say, \u201cSomeone\u2019s been eating my porridge,\u201d or \u201cSomeone\u2019s been sleeping in my bed\u201d, because bears can only speak bear.</p> <p>They did what bears do. They ate her. And they lived happily ever after.</p> <p>There are many people who believe this is the proper way to tell a fairy story. With facts. Because facts are true, and a fact-based education will, according to the British government, be far more useful at helping you to get a job once you\u2019ve graduated from university.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/23/scienceandnature.richarddawkins\" title=\"\"><em>The God Delusion</em></a>, agrees. He announced a few years ago that most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/05/richard-dawkins-fairytales-not-harmful\" title=\"\">fairytales</a> do not stand up to scientific scrutiny. \u201cThere\u2019s a very interesting reason why a princess could not turn into a frog,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s statistically too improbable.\u201d</p> <p>Fairytales are dangerous, Dawkins believes. Parents \u201cshould be fostering in children a spirit of scepticism instead of filling their heads with fantasy\u201d. Children\u2019s imaginations are dangerous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9bfdbd71c14ca7b8a4d8327edb1cf7ef20fde5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9bfdbd71c14ca7b8a4d8327edb1cf7ef20fde5c/0_0_7186_4313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beauty and the Beast: \u2018Without stories we are trapped in a static version of ourselves.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beauty and the Beast: \u2018Without stories we are trapped in a static version of ourselves.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a point upon which Dawkins and the British government agree. In recent years there has been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/artsinschools\" title=\"\">steep decline</a> in the number of pupils taking up the arts \u2013 design, drama, dance, music, painting, sculpture. Study science, economics and maths, the government urges, and pursue a serious career \u2013 such as business, law, banking and finance. A real career, where you can make real money.</p> <p>There is, of course, nothing wrong with studying mathematics and science. But without the arts, that study is wasted. You need imagination to be a great scientist (or a great politician or a\u00a0great lawyer), just as you need it to be a\u00a0great musician or writer. Imagination and the ability to tell a story will make anyone better at anything.</p> <p>As Albert Einstein said: \u201cIf you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales.\u201d Einstein recognised the importance of imagination and storytelling when grappling with the most complex and difficult problems of the universe.</p> <p>Science tells us that 7 billion improbably designed humans live on a ball made of iron, rocks and silicates, floating in a regular ellipse around a hot star in the middle of unimaginable infinite space. And furthermore, these humans have designed Teslas, cricket and waterboarding.</p> <p>Is there a more unlikely story? Most scientific explanations for the workings of the universe are so weird, you\u2019d have to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/douglasadams\" title=\"\">Douglas Adams</a> to think them up. The most popular begins with a huge explosion out of nothingness, from which a vast infinity of objects emerge, moving away from each other for billions of years until one day the whole thing loses momentum and shifts into reverse, collapsing to the size of a raisin.</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>Dawkins thinks the whole idea of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden\u00a0is absurd, but what sane person dreamed up the big bang theory?</p> <p>At the start of every amazing story \u2013 literary or scientific \u2013 is a person with enough imagination to ask a good question. A physicist might ask: \u201cWhat makes up all that empty space in the universe?\u201d A geneticist might ask: \u201cIs there a different way to cure cancer?\u201d A\u00a0science fiction writer might ask: \u201cWhat do creatures in another galaxy look like?\u201d You or I might ask: \u201cWill anyone ever want to have sex with me?\u201d or \u201cHow can I live in a world where Donald Trump is president?\u201d</p> <p>The job of every human is to imagine what one life might achieve, to think about why we live and why we die, why we fall in love with one person and not another; why there\u2019s war, why some people are black and some white, some rich and some poor. Our job is to think about how to live on this planet without destroying it, to reimagine the past and the future of the human race; to examine all the complex, terrifying, hopeful possibilities in history, in politics, in space \u2013 and in the space inside our heads.</p> <p>One of the best ways to start answering questions such as \u201cwho am I?\u201d and \u201cwhat can I do in the world?\u201d is to read\u00a0books.</p> <p>I would say that. I\u2019m a writer. But in my lifetime I\u2019ve lived thousands of lives. I\u2019ve lived on other continents and other planets, been a champion runner, a neurosurgeon, a standup comedian. I\u2019ve survived Auschwitz and a plane crash in the Andes, fought with the East India Company in the 1857 uprising. I\u2019ve bombed Ferrara, crossed the Pacific on a raft, advised Henry VIII not to marry again. I\u2019ve lived inside the head of a man, a horse, a vampire, a gentle Neanderthal. I know what it feels like to be different, to be on the wrong side of history, to be someone other than a middle-class, middle-aged suburban-born American writer who now lives a somewhat ordinary life in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b24b844441317a593b48e6386f068c35039aa01d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b24b844441317a593b48e6386f068c35039aa01d/0_156_2030_1218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sword in the Stone: \u2018Stories give us choices.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sword in the Stone: \u2018Stories give us choices.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 5</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of this I have learned by reading books.</p> <p>Imagine a person who never reads books. Perhaps a person like the president of the United States. What might it do to your brain, never to be anyone other than yourself, in your own here and now? To be a person who knows nothing about how it feels to be a Roman legionary, a Victorian chimney sweep, to be poor, queer, a refugee, a Muslim, a North Korean, a woman, a child, a warrior \u2013 who knows nothing about how it feels to be someone else.</p> <p>Without stories we are trapped in a static version of ourselves.</p> <p>Stories give us choices. In 2013, a 16-year-old girl stood up at a book festival I attended, saying how much she appreciated the way teen novels were helping to change gender and sex stereotypes at her school. There was less bullying, she said, more acceptance of difference. Since 2013, it seems as if our entire understanding of gender and sex has changed \u2013 what was once considered unnatural has become mainstream. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/08/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-transitioning-kardashians-reality-tv-star\" title=\"\">Caitlyn Jenner</a> made celebrity history. Stories told us how it felt.</p> <p>Each of us is writing a life story. Every day we write another chapter. Some sections are page turners, cliffhangers, potboilers. Others drone on endlessly without incident \u2013 the hero will never fall in love, find a career, figure out how to be a person. Each of us is responsible for imagining the best life possible: the funniest, bravest, most meaningful.</p> <p>Most days I wake up thinking that the world is a mess. I worry about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\" title=\"\">climate change</a>, refugees and world war III. I worry about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> and sexual slavery and children dying of starvation.</p> <p>On those days, I think about TH White\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/06/philip-womack-my-inspiration-sword-stone-white\" title=\"\"><em>The Sword in the Stone</em></a>, and Merlin speaking to the young King Arthur. \u201cThe best thing for being sad is\u00a0to learn something,\u201d says Merlin. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that never fails.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned to write my own fairytales. In my fairytale, the bears don\u2019t eat Goldilocks. She and the baby bear fall in love. They run off together, grow up, have their own baby. The baby is half-human, half-bear; brave and strong and fierce. They call her Celeste, and she grows up to be president of the United Nations of Earth. She governs wisely over a happy and peaceful world for generations to come.</p> <p>That\u2019s my fairytale. Now write yours.</p> <p>This is an edited version of a speech given at the Berlin literature festival.</p>",

The child that takes maths GCSE while still in single figures, or a rarity such as Ruth Lawrence, who was admitted to Oxford while her contemporaries were still in primary school.</p> <p>But look closer and a different story emerges. Mirzakhani was born in Tehran, one of three siblings in a middle-class family whose father was an engineer. The only part of her childhood that was out of the ordinary was the Iran-Iraq war, which made life hard for the family in her early years. Thankfully it ended around the time she went to secondary school.</p> <p>Mirzakhani, did go to a highly selective girls\u2019 school but maths wasn\u2019t her interest \u2013 reading was. She loved novels and would read anything she could lay her hands on; together with her best friend she would prowl the book stores on the way home from school for works to buy and consume.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/audio/2010/may/31/science-weekly-live-podcast-genius\">The Guardian's Science Weekly podcast: What makes a genius?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for maths, she did rather poorly at it for the first couple of years in her middle school, but became interested when her elder brother told her about what he\u2019d learned. He shared a famous maths problem from a magazine that fascinated her \u2013 and she was hooked. The rest is mathematical history.</p> <p>Is her background unusual? Apparently not. Most Nobel laureates were unexceptional in childhood. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Einstein</a> was slow to talk and was dubbed the dopey one by the family maid. He failed the general part of the entry test to Zurich Polytechnic \u2013 though they let him in because of high physics and maths scores. He struggled at work initially, failing to get academic post and being passed over for promotion at the Swiss Patent Office because he wasn\u2019t good enough at machine technology. But he kept plugging away and eventually rewrote the laws of Newtonian mechanics with his theory of relativity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lifecourse.web.unc.edu/research_projects/terman/\">Lewis Terman</a>, a pioneering American educational psychologist, set up a study in 1921 following 1,470 Californians, who excelled in the newly available IQ tests, throughout their lives. None ended up as the great thinkers of their age that Terman expected they would. But he did miss two future Nobel prize winners \u2013 Luis Alvarez and William Shockley, both physicists \u2013 whom he dismissed from the study as their test scores were not high enough.</p> <p>There is a canon of research on high performance, built over the last century, that suggests it goes way beyond tested intelligence. On top of that, research is clear that brains are malleable, new neural pathways can be forged, and IQ isn\u2019t fixed. Just because you can read Harry Potter at five doesn\u2019t mean you will still be ahead of your contemporaries in your teens.</p> <p>According to my colleague, Prof Deborah Eyre, with whom I\u2019ve collaborated on the book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/great-minds-and-how-to-grow-them.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Great Minds and How to Grow Them</a>, the latest neuroscience and psychological research suggests most people, unless they are cognitively impaired, can reach standards of performance associated in school with the gifted and talented. However, they must be taught the right attitudes and approaches to their learning and develop the attributes of high performers \u2013 curiosity, persistence and hard work, for example \u2013 an approach Eyre calls \u201chigh performance learning\u201d. Critically, they need the right support in developing those approaches at home as well as at school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97cca712ae6cc10002dc4668bf6e20acc3d0fd93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97cca712ae6cc10002dc4668bf6e20acc3d0fd93/374_0_5626_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maryam Mirzakhani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maryam Mirzakhani won the Fields Medal, the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel prize, but showed little maths ability to begin with.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clay Mathematics Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, is there even such a thing as a gifted child? It is a highly contested area. Prof Anders Ericsson, an eminent education psychologist at Florida State University, is the co-author of Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise. After research going back to 1980 into diverse achievements, from music to memory to sport, he doesn\u2019t think unique and innate talents are at the heart of performance. Deliberate practice, that stretches you every step of the way, and around 10,000 hours of it, is what produces the expert. It\u2019s not a magic number \u2013 the highest performers move on to doing a whole lot more, of course, and, like Mirzakhani, often find their own unique perspective along the way.</p> <p>Ericsson\u2019s memory research is particularly interesting because random students, trained in memory techniques for the study, went on to outperform others thought to have innately superior memories \u2013 those you might call gifted.</p> <p>He got into the idea of researching the effects of deliberate practice because of an incident at school, in which he was beaten at chess by someone who used to lose to him. His opponent had clearly practised.</p> <p>But it is perhaps the work of Benjamin Bloom, another distinguished American educationist working in the 1980s, that gives the most pause for thought and underscores the idea that family is intrinsically important to the concept of high performance.</p> <p>Bloom\u2019s team looked at a group of extraordinarily high achieving people in disciplines as varied as ballet, swimming, piano, tennis, maths, sculpture and neurology, and interviewed not only the individuals but their parents, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/how-to-raise-a-brilliant-child-without-screwing-them-up\">How to raise a brilliant child without screwing them up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He found a pattern of parents encouraging and supporting their children, in particular in areas they enjoyed themselves. Bloom\u2019s outstanding adults had worked very hard and consistently at something they had become hooked on young, and their parents all emerged as having strong work ethics themselves.</p> <p>While the jury is out on giftedness being innate and other factors potentially making the difference, what is certain is that the behaviours associated with high levels of performance are replicable and most can be taught \u2013 even traits such as curiosity.</p> <p>Eyre says we know how high performers learn. From that she has developed a high performing learning approach that brings together in one package what she calls the advanced cognitive characteristics, and the values, attitudes and attributes of high performance. She is working on the package with a group of pioneer schools, both in Britain and abroad.</p> <p>But the system needs to be adopted by families, too, to ensure widespread success across classes and cultures. Research in Britain shows the difference parents make if they take part in simple activities pre-school in the home, supporting reading for example. That support shows through years later in better A-level results, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/research/featured-research/effective-pre-school-primary-secondary-education-project\">Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary study</a>, conducted over 15 years by a team from Oxford and London universities.</p> <p>Eye-opening spin-off research, which looked in detail at 24 of the 3,000 individuals being studied who were succeeding against the odds, found something remarkable about what was going in at home. Half were on free school meals because of poverty, more than half were living with a single parent, and four in five were living in deprived areas.</p> <p>The interviews uncovered strong evidence of an adult or adults in the child\u2019s life who valued and supported education, either in the immediate or extended family or in the child\u2019s wider community. Children talked about the need to work hard at school and to listen in class and keep trying. They referenced key adults who had encouraged those attitudes.</p> <p>Einstein, the epitome of a genius, clearly had curiosity, character and determination. He struggled against rejection in early life but was undeterred. Did he think he was a genius or even gifted? No. He once wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m so smart, it\u2019s just that I stay with problems longer. Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character.\u201d</p> <p>And what about Mirzakhani? Her published quotations show someone who was curious and excited by what she did and resilient. One comment sums it up. \u201cOf course, the most rewarding part is the \u2018Aha\u2019 moment, the excitement of discovery and enjoyment of understanding something new \u2013 the feeling of being on top of a hill and having a clear view. But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being on a long hike with no trail and no end in sight.\u201d</p> <p>The trail took her to the heights of original research into mathematics in a cruelly short life. That sounds like unassailable character. Perhaps that was her gift.</p> <p><em>Great Minds and How to Grow Them, by Wendy Berliner &amp; Deborah Eyre.

The <a href=\"http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/100\">paper</a> which swung the scientific consensus in favour of the existence of photons was published by Albert Einstein in 1905, and yet in 1951 he wrote to an old friend</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These fifty years of conscious brooding have not brought me any closer to an answer to the question: \u201cWhat are light quanta?\u201d Today the first rascal believes he knows what they are, but he deludes himself.

This is a pretty general approach among physicists; what something \u201cis\u201d is defined by its properties. </p> <p>Photons exhibit an incredibly wide range of behaviour, depending upon their wavelength, how densely they are packed together, what materials they are interacting with and what direction they are spinning.

When things break up like that in a particle collision, we call it \u201cinelastic\u201d scattering.</p> <p>A much more elusive process is the elastic scattering of photons; light bouncing off light, and nothing else being produced. The term \u201celastic\u201d is used because, as when bouncing a rubber ball, the amount of kinetic energy \u2013 the energy of motion of the ball \u2013 is conserved. The ball bounces back pretty much as hard as you throw it. (In an inelastic collision some of this energy is distributed amongst the new particles, or lost as heat, or otherwise converted into a different form.)</p> <p>The first strong evidence for the elastic scattering of photons at high energies has just been <a href=\"http://atlas.cern/updates/press-statement\">reported</a> by the ATLAS experiment (which I work on) at the Large Hadron Collider. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys4208.html\">measurement</a> of this process is made during the periods when the LHC is smashing lead nuclei together, rather than in its usual proton-smashing mode. Because the lead nucleus has a charge 82 times that of the proton, and because electric charge is a source of photons, there is a dense cloud of high-energy photons accompanying the bunches\u00b9 of nuclei. Sometimes nuclei hit each other, sometimes they hit photons, and sometimes \u2013 more rarely \u2013 photons hit each other and bounce off elastically.</p> <p>The analysis involves identifying photons in the ATLAS detector in collision events which are otherwise very quiet. The picture at the top of the article shows a representation of the real data from once such collision. The beams come from behind and in front of the picture and collide in the centre of the blue and purple circles. Those circles are the charged-particle detectors of ATLAS, showing almost no activity, because photons carry no electric charge. The green and yellow wedges show the energy deposited by the scattered photons in the calorimeter \u2013 the part of ATLAS responsible for energy measurement. A more usual lead-lead collision would be a bit busier, something like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"803d5cdb7130858cddd2d7de98f7176e0578a3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/803d5cdb7130858cddd2d7de98f7176e0578a3a5/0_265_2365_1419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the first higher energy (13 TeV) heavy ion collisions recorded by the ALICE detector, on 25 November 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the first higher energy (13 TeV) heavy ion collisions recorded by the ALICE detector, on 25 November 2015</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ALICE/CERN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elastic light-light scattering is an intrinsically quantum-mechanical process.

          "body": "<p>The Cambridge polymath William Whewell wrote in 1837 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/isaac-newton\" title=\"\">Isaac Newton</a>\u2019s introduction of a universal law of gravity a century and a half earlier was \u201cindisputably and incomparably the greatest scientific discovery ever made\u201d. The judgment still looks sound. Gravity continues to make headlines, as we saw last year when astronomers first directly observed gravity waves, predicted a century before by Albert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\" title=\"\">Einstein</a> using his theory of gravity. This was not revolutionary theory, he often said, but simply a rational development of the Newtonian framework it superseded.</p> <p>In <em>The Ascent of Gravity</em>, the science writer and former astrophysicist Marcus Chown traces our understanding of gravity from Newton\u2019s pioneering ideas to the present state of well-informed perplexity. Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity has passed every observational test with flying colours but no one has succeeded in making it consistent with\u00a0the other great theory of modern physics, quantum mechanics, which accurately describes the world on the smallest scale. Although physicists have made impressive progress towards a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists\" title=\"\">quantum theory of gravity</a>, the subject is in a bit of a mess.</p> <p>Chown begins by describing how Newton gave the first mathematically precise account of gravity in his <em>Principia</em>. Central to it was his unifying insight that the type of force pulling an apple vertically downwards is the same as the force holding celestial objects in their orbits around the sun. The theory\u00a0was a triumph, offering a clear understanding of tides, an elegant explanation of the puzzling regularities in planetary orbits and predictions of the paths of other celestial objects. As\u00a0Chown says: \u201cThe law of universal gravity is a gift that keeps on giving.\u201d</p> <p>In Newton\u2019s view, a mathematical description of God\u2019s universe, consistent with all observations, was the best that could be achieved. But many of his peers on the continent strongly disagreed. The theory must explain why gravity exists, they argued, not just apply ingenious mathematics to it. As one influential reviewer in France put it, Newton \u201chas not considered [the] principles as a physicist, but as a mere mathematician\u201d. Although there was no doubting his theory of gravity\u2019s success in accounting for observations, Newton was never able to demonstrate that his theory could account for the stability of\u00a0the solar system and for some fine details of the moon\u2019s motion. When he\u00a0was 70 he gave up trying: \u201cI\u00a0am satisfied that it will never be perfected but by somebody who understands the theory of gravity as well or better than I do.\u201d</p> <p>It was the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace and his associates who first demonstrated that Newton\u2019s universal law of gravity accounts fully for the motion of celestial objects and the solar system\u2019s stability. Between 1799 and 1825, Laplace presented it in <em>Celestial Mechanics</em>, his masterpiece of\u00a0gravity theory published in five volumes, one of them dedicated to his benefactor, Napoleon. Chown surprisingly makes no mention of his work or the impact it had on science. Inspired by the success of Newton\u2019s account of gravity, Laplace and his school strove to understand other basic forces of nature all with the same mathematical form as the law of gravity. Thus began the modern discipline of physics, essentially a French invention.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chown sets out the key ideas clearly without recourse to jargon and intimi\u00addating mathematics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chown does Einstein proud in demonstrating the origins and consequences of his new theory of gravity, aptly described by the physicist Max Born as\u00a0\u201cthe most amazing combination of philosophical penetration, physical intuition and mathematical skill\u201d. Einstein was motivated not only by tiny disagreements between observations and Newton\u2019s theory, Chown explains, but also because the theory was not consistent with the basic theory of relativity. Soon after Einstein learned the correct mathematical approach, he understood that the concept of the force of gravity needed to be replaced by the local curvature of space-time. It took him eight years to complete the theory, which he finalised in the nick of time, in November 1915, just pipping the mathematician David Hilbert to the post.</p> <p>Chown is good company. He tells his story clearly and sets out the key ideas without recourse to jargon and intimidating mathematics. As he makes plain, Einstein had come up with another theory of gravity that was profoundly revealing. Its fundamental equation, which can be written on the palm of a human hand, contains a wealth of insights about nature, including predictions not only of gravitational waves but of exotic new objects such as black holes and wormholes. Furthermore, as Einstein showed, it gives the theoretical basis of modern cosmology.</p> <p>Much of <em>The Ascent of Gravity</em> covers well-trodden ground, but in the final part Chown takes us into less familiar territory, exploring current research into quantum theories of gravity. The most popular of them \u2013 based on the idea that most fundamental entities of\u00a0nature are tiny, vibrating pieces of\u00a0string\u00a0\u2013 gave the first serviceable explanation of why gravity exists: it\u00a0emerges unavoidably from the mathematics. Although experts have made advances in string theory, they have not yet been able to use it to make any predictions that experimenters can check, fuelling scepticism about the basic approach.</p> <p>But today\u2019s leading gravity theorists are not downcast. To find out where they believe their subject is heading, Chown has talked with several experts, including the Canadian <a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/scholars/arkani-hamed\" title=\"\">Nima Arkani-Hamed</a>, a highly regarded theoretician based at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton. Arkani-Hamed is optimistic that quantum theory and the basic theory of relativity are together leading us to a quantum theory of gravity and of the other fundamental forces of nature. He says experts are \u201cpretty universally agreed\u201d that their current best understanding of space and time is \u201cdoomed\u201d.</p> <p>To establish a completely satisfactory quantum theory of gravity may well take another indisputably and incomparably great discovery, which is why so many talented young physicists risk going into this extremely challenging field. \u201cThere has never been a better time to study gravity,\u201d Arkani-Hamed insists, and Chown\u2019s eminently readable book helps us understand why.</p> <p>\u2022 Graham Farmelo is the author of <em>Churchill\u2019s Bomb </em>(Faber). <em>The Ascent of Gravity</em> is published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson.

It\u2019s like I\u2019m a massive, 10-tonne boulder rolling down the hill.\u201d</p> <p>Dyslexia causes reading and spelling challenges, but positivity about the condition is a growing part of the campaign to improve awareness and coping strategies. The British Dyslexia Association is exploring the theme during the annual <a href=\"http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/fundraising/dyslexia-awareness-week\">Dyslexia Awareness Week</a> next month, with events in schools and the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/positivedyslexia2017?src=hash\">#positivedyslexia2017</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI have five severely dyslexic children,\u201d says the association\u2019s policy manager Sue Flohr, who is herself dyslexic. \u201cThey\u2019re now a doctor, a teacher, a photographer, a designer and a nightclub manager. Dyslexia doesn\u2019t prohibit anything, and being positive about it encourages children to find their strengths while working around weaknesses.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c51374892082972844f08e413299ebe6c0dc3139\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c51374892082972844f08e413299ebe6c0dc3139/130_0_1907_2382/801.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Einstein\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Einstein: the theoretical physicist didn\u2019t let his dyslexia stop him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doreen Spooner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/illustrated-guide-to-dyslexia-and-its-amazing-people.html\">The Illustrated Guide to Dyslexia and Its Amazing People</a>, published later this month, is written by two dyslexic mothers of dyslexic children. After a foreword by the dyslexic architect Richard Rogers, it offers practical solutions to particular challenges while also celebrating dyslexia\u2019s advantages. \u201cSchool can still be demoralising, but when you hear about people doing superbly well in all kinds of careers, it really helps,\u201d says co-author Kate Power.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-advantages-of-dyslexia/\">Research</a> into possible differences in the wiring of the brain is ongoing, but tests routinely show that dyslexics are better at spatial reasoning and \u201cseeing the bigger picture\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to do what I do if I wasn\u2019t dyslexic,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.jimrokos.com/\">Jim Rokos</a>, a product designer and the curator of <a href=\"https://thedesignjunction.co.uk/london/dyslexic-design/\">Dyslexic Design</a>, an exhibition that was mounted in London last year. \u201cI can play with shapes and do experiments in my head in a way that other designers might not be able to.\u201d</p> <p>Rokos also believes that, if nothing else, the expectation of failure many dyslexics learn at school means they are more willing to take a risk and try new things (you are expected to fail, so why not?). But otherwise, he adds, \u201cIf you were to design a system to remove a person\u2019s self confidence, you\u2019d come up with schools. So, for someone such as Jamie Oliver to say this really helps give some hope so that kids can get through to adulthood.\u201d</p>",

Not much, apart from all being part of a new boom of graphic biographies.</p> <p>Using comics to tell life stories is an established art: think Maus, Art Spiegelman\u2019s investigation of his family\u2019s ordeal during the Holocaust; or Marjane Satrapi\u2019s Persepolis, her memoir of an Iranian childhood. More recently, the March trilogy by US congressman and civil rights hero John Lewis, with Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell, was sent shooting up bestseller charts after a spat between Lewis and US president Donald Trump.</p> <p>But while superheroes, science fiction and horror still comprise the majority of the comic book market, a flood of deeply researched graphic biographies have recently been published. Some subjects \u2013 Vincent Van Gogh, Albert Einstein, Gandhi, Sigmund Freud \u2013 are well-known; others less so, such as novelist and folklorist <a href=\"https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/blog/2017/03/fire-zora-neale-hurston-story\">Zora Neale Hurston in Fire!!</a>, or 19th-century ornithologist John James Audubon, in the sumptuously illustrated <a href=\"http://nobrow.net/shop/audubon-on-the-wings-of-the-world/\">On The Wings of the World</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58a80ff06cbb25ed54bf9362bbee52bad1053826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58a80ff06cbb25ed54bf9362bbee52bad1053826/0_0_1725_2370/728.jpg\" alt=\"Fire!!

With a biography there are a lot of people going to be questioning you and what you create about a person.\u201d</p> <p>Bagge starts by reading traditional biographies of his subjects, then boils down their lives into a series of key moments. In his biography of Hurston, Bagge pinpointed moments such as when the magazine Opportunity \u2013 \u201cThe Journal of Negro Life\u201d \u2013 accepted her first short story in 1924, and or when she moved to Harlem on the advice of the editor. Bagge writes all of this into a script he later uses uses to draw from. Without pages and pages of exposition, comics can boil a life down to the bare essentials by marrying art and text \u2013 Hurston\u2019s being accepted for publication and moving to New York is told in a single page.</p> <p>Bagge\u2019s first full-length graphic biography was <a href=\"https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/woman-rebel\">Woman Rebel</a>, about activist and birth control campaigner Margaret Sanger. \u201cI don\u2019t set out to cover the entire lives of the people I write about,\u201d he says. \u201cWith both Sanger and Hurston, their lives were very busy and interesting right up to the end, so it\u2019s a case of making that work in comic form.\u201d</p> <p>The whole process takes around three years per book \u2013 but it\u2019s a long haul that Bagge enjoys. He is currently at work on a biography of Rose Wilder Lane, the writer and journalist daughter of Little House on the Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder. \u201cReality beats the made-up stuff,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The compact form does not mean there is any less research, say Anne Simon and Corinne Maier, who created bestselling biographies of Karl Marx, Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. Like Bagge, artist Simon researches to \u201cfind \u2018my\u2019 Freud, \u2018my\u2019 Marx, \u2018my\u2019 Einstein\u201d, while writer Maier reads extensively about her subject before starting. While she knew the life and work of Freud, and understood Marxism, she says she knew nothing about Einstein. \u201cI was very surprised to learn that he was a womaniser!\u201d she says. \u201cI could not imagine him in bed with a woman \u2026 but seriously, I immersed myself in relativity, I sweated blood and water to try to understand it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7560b118e2d5219133207e498a69ecd71ccbda7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7560b118e2d5219133207e498a69ecd71ccbda7/0_0_600_791/379.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein graphic novel biography\" width=\"379\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maier explains Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity in a page.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nobrow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The popularity of comic-book biographies has seen subjects who might not get attention from a prose publisher immortalised on the page. These include Somali runner and refugee Samia Yusuf Omar, featured in An Olympic Dream by Reinhard Kleist; or The Boxer, from the same author, about Holocaust survivor Harry Haft; and adventurous journalist William Seabrook, in Joe Ollmann\u2019s The Abominable Mr Seabrook.</p> <p>This shift may strike the cynically minded as a turn for the horribly stupid, like the apocryphal tales of students using <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/books/rarebooks/comics-moby-dick-albert-kanter-three-muskateers/classics-illustrated.shtml\">Classic Illustrated comic books </a>like Moby-Dick to do their English literature homework, instead of, say, the actual Moby-Dick. But aren\u2019t comic-book biographies, due to their layout, unavoidably less detailed than their traditional counterparts?</p> <p>Not at all, says Sam Humphrey, of British comics publisher SelfMadeHero, who praises comic-book biographies as being part of a sophisticated shift away from superheroes: \u201c[They] are often concise, accessible, even breezy, but they rarely lack the weight of research. The kind of scene-setting that might require 20 pages of prose can be accomplished in a couple pages of artwork; a single splash page can conjure the sights, sounds and smells of a particular place at a particular time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they can be read in a day or two \u2013 that\u2019s an obvious benefit.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>Isaac Newton set it up for Albert Einstein: he calculated a system of heavenly motion that governed the entire measurable cosmos. He then added a challenge: a theory, he wrote \u201cthat agrees exactly with exact astronomical observations cannot fail to be true.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He didn\u2019t live to find out quite how much frustration that claim would give his fellow astronomers, who identified Uranus, and then from the behaviour of Uranus inferred the existence of another planet, and finally identified Neptune. They relied on Newton\u2019s predictions, which were spot on and self-evidently right, all the way to the edge of the solar system - except for one tiny little niggling detail about the planet closest to the sun. </p> <p>Mercury\u2019s orbit precesses around the sun at a rate that cannot be fully accounted for by Newtonian mechanics. The discrepancy is very small, but it isn\u2019t an observational error. And since Newton\u2019s theory could hardly be wrong, the only answer that made sense was that there must be another small, invisible companion affecting the orbit of Mercury. So sure were astronomers that this companion planet must exist, they even gave it a name: Vulcan.</p> <p>Vulcan remained a notional member of the solar system right up to November 1915, when Albert Einstein unfurled a theory of general relativity that provided a different and more successful explanation of the phenomenon of gravitational attraction. The Hunt for Vulcan is an object lesson in how science is done, why scientists sometimes get things wrong, and ultimately, why they get things right. </p> <p>Thomas Levenson\u2019s book is one of six finalists in the Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book prize. It is already a winner, in the sense that each of the runners up gets a \u00a32,500 award. But the overall \u00a325,000 winner is to be announced on 19 September by a team of judges led by the author Bill Bryson, himself a Science Book prize winner in 2004. </p> <p>The other candidates, all previously reviewed in the Guardian, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/17/most-perfect-thing-inside-birds-egg-tim-birkhead-review-alex-preston\">The Most Perfect Thing</a>, by Tim Birkhead (Bloomsbury);  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/05/cure-a-journey-into-the-science-of-mind-over-body-by-jo-marchant-review\">Cure</a>, by Jo Marchant (Canongate);</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/02/atomsphere-hope-tim-flannery-planet-remade-oliver-morton-review\">The Planet Remade</a>, by Oliver Morton; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/06/the-gene-an-intimate-history-siddhartha-mukherjee-review\">The Gene</a>, by Siddhartha Mukherjee (Bodley Head) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/13/the-invention-of-nature-the-adventures-of-alexander-von-humboldt-andrea-wulf-review\">The Invention of Nature</a>, by Andrea Wulf (John Murray).</p> <p>Some science books explore new science, or neglected science, or enduring puzzles, or forgotten adventures in science. Levenson\u2019s is a fresh, smartly-paced account of a story much of which has already been told in different forms many times and especially last year, on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/25/video-100-years-of-einsteins-general-relativity\"> hundredth birthday of Einstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity</a>. </p> <p>Don\u2019t discount it for that. By making Vulcan the star turn, so to speak, Levenson shines a light on how science really happens. Other histories of planetary discovery speed past the mistakes and get to the great achievements. Levenson follows the twists and turns of the Vulcan pursuit \u2013 including the newspaper reports, the academic bickering and frustration \u2013 and with a light touch delivers serious lessons. One of them, which should be a comfort to us all, is that scientists keep on testing their own assumptions, and questioning their own observations. Yes, if they expect to find something, there is a likelihood that they will see what they are looking for, but they don\u2019t like to be the only people to see it. The lesson is that good science is replicable. </p> <p>The other is that good scientists worry about tiny details: it\u2019s not enough to be broadly right. If you can\u2019t be dead right then something must be wrong. </p> <p>So if Newton was consistently right then there must be another explanation for an anomaly in Mercury\u2019s orbit: if the missing planet or asteroid hadn\u2019t already been seen it must be masked by the sun, in which case it ought to be visible during solar eclipse.</p> <p>The now-you-see-it, now-you-don\u2019t story of Vulcan provides a lot of the fun in Levenson\u2019s text, and at the same time introduces unexpected characters (among them Thomas Alva Edison) in a comedy of errors that lasted from 1859 to 1915, or possibly to 1919, when Sir Arthur Eddington observed an eclipse and claimed confirmation of Einstein\u2019s predictions (and I am especially grateful for the New York Times headline coverage: \u201cLIGHTS ALL ASKEW IN THE HEAVENS. Men of Science More or Less Agog Over Results of Eclipse Observations.\u201d)</p> <p>New readers who want to learn how the solar system works could profit from this book. Those who think they already know the story of the revolution in astronomy from Newton to Einstein will find episodes new to them. And those looking for a moral will find one nicely phrased: \u201cScience is unique among human ways of knowing because it is self-correcting,\u201d writes Levenson. \u201cEvery claim is provisional.\u201d </p> <ul> <li>To order The Hunt for Vulcan: how Albert Einstein Destroyed a Planet and Deciphered the Universe for \u00a36.55 (Head of Zeus, RRP\u00a37.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hunt-for-vulcan-425142.html\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Jesus, I need a lie down.</p> <p>Anyway, what a superb book. Exquisitely written, full of real, believable characters, funny and desperately sad. I wouldn\u2019t have picked this up if my wife hadn\u2019t shoved it at me, probably because it sounds and looks a little feminine, but I\u2019m so glad she did because I have discovered another new author.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the subject of books that might easily have been missed, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4515468\">vermontlogger </a>feels lucky to have picked up Einstein: His Life And Universe by Walter Isaacson:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I knew nothing about it until I chanced on it at a book sale and started dipping in. Apparently it was a number one bestseller, and you can see why. The writing is magnificently fluent and attractive. Some of the passages dealing with the great man\u2019s early life do seem a bit dutiful but the author really lets his excitement show when he gets into explaining the papers on the Special and General Theories. He takes you step by step through the process that allowed Einstein to arrive at his \u201chead-snapping\u201d insights (all by deduction from newly postulated first principles and none by induction from the experimental data) in such a clear way that even a non-scientist like me can hold it in his brain for a fleeting second. One cosmological implication Einstein drew was that three-dimensional space can curve back on itself to create a system that is simultaneously finite and unbounded. How cool is that!</p> </blockquote> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15111626\">TheLittlestRascal</a> missed The Blade Itself first time around:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For some reason, couldn\u2019t get past the first hundred of pages a few years back, but figured it deserved one more chance.</p> <p>This brick of a book sets the scene for the following novels of the trilogy and introduces most of the key players, which include barbarians, noblemen, inquisitors, and magi. And by the time I finished the chapter aptly titled \u201cA Road Between Two Dentists\u201d I had already developed some strong feelings for the inquisitor. Well, of course I just had to. </p> <p>It feels like our postmodern world deserves its own postmodern fantasy, and <em>The Blade Itself </em>seems to be one of those: lots of allusions to Discworld and pop-culture references to be picked up along the way. A fight of two rugged barbarians reminds of some classic spaghetti western, and preparation for a fencing contest resembles the best bits of Rocky. Not sure how much of that was intended, but it definitely felt good to stumble upon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Revisiting a book has also been profitable for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3349583\">Glozboy</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m currently re-reading Stephen King\u2019s It, 16 years after I first read it as a teenager. I remembered it being consistently scary and some of the scenes have never left me.</p> <p>So far I\u2019m 400 pages in and it hasn\u2019t let up. An absolute masterpiece.</p> <p>This is one of those books that I never want to see the film/TV series of as it would destroy my mental image, <em>The Stand</em> being another one.</p> </blockquote> <p>Zola\u2019s Germinal has also been worth rereading for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is the novel, way back, that had me fall in love with Zola, and I have to say it still doesn\u2019t disappoint. This brutal tale of life on the northern French coalfields in the 1860s during a long strike is stunning. From Zola\u2019s depiction of the everyday life of coalminers, the clash between Capital and Labour, Socialism and Anarchism at the time of the First International, and Zola\u2019s great narrative of the course of the destructive strike, this is a sweeping portrait of some of the worst of 19th Century industrial life. Undoubtedly it is one of the greatest Victorian novels.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, it\u2019s almost Halloween, isn\u2019t it?

The best ones are exquisitely crafted, and you hover between admiration of the writer\u2019s sheer skill and the pure terror of the tale itself. The only stumbling-block is the occasional story that hinges on the protagonist acting in a manner that\u2019s frankly incomprehensible to modern sensibilities; poor Aubrey in Polidori\u2019s The Vampyre is such a relentlessly moronic goop it\u2019s hard to feel very sorry for him, and so is Ernest in The Bride of Lindorf. (What a <em>plonker</em>.) But I really loved most of the other stories in the Oxford University Press anthology The Vampyre and other Tales of the Macabre. It was fascinating to see the themes and anxieties of live burial and grave robbing come out in the stories again and again. Alan Cunningham\u2019s The Master of Logan had an atmosphere and themes that reminded me of Stevenson, and Catherine Gore\u2019s The Red Man was terrifying.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li>A growing list of <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/apersonalanthology\">fantasy anthologies of short fiction</a>.</li> <li>On the <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/09/21/human-life-is-punishment-on-the-pleasures-of-studying-latin/#more-115752\">delights of learning Latin</a>.</li> <li>Rod Mengham <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/09/06/rod-mengham/the-eighth-hill-of-rome/?utm_source=LRB+blog+email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20170919+blog&amp;utm_content=ukrw_nonsubs\">writes about the eighth hill of Rome in the London Review of Books</a>.</li> <li><a href=\"http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/event/david-lynch-week-club-silencio/\">A tiny list</a>, but still fascinating for the David Lynch fans among us (although you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the genius director likes Franz Kafka.)</li> </ul> <p>If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

          "body": "<p>We all travel in time mentally when we think about the past or the future, and I for one close my eyes every night and travel instantaneously into tomorrow. But the idea of some kind of technology that allows us to literally transport ourselves to a different era is surprisingly recent. James Gleick\u2019s historical survey of the concept concludes that, apart from a couple of vague anticipations in the 19th century, the idea really was invented in 1895, in HG Wells\u2019s novel <em>The Time Machine</em>.</p> <p>Cue more than a century of literary, philosophical and scientific investigations into the topic. There are logical knots aplenty, as when people travel back in time to kill their ancestors (the Grandfather Paradox). There are alt-history fantasies of killing Hitler. There is a flux capacitor powering a DeLorean time machine; there is a Time Lord zooming around in an old police phone box; and there is the head-spinning set of nested time loops in Shane Carruth\u2019s extraordinary micro-budget first film, <em>Primer</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/11/doctor-who-why-we-are-all-time-travellers-now\">Do we still need Doctor Who? Time travel in the internet age</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last example is not mentioned in this book, but a lot else is, including more metaphorical forms of time travel: there is a fascinating, wry chapter, for example, on the craze for burying cultural objects inside \u201ctime capsules\u201d in the hope that our descendants won\u2019t think we were all complete idiots. (The time capsule, Gleick writes, is \u201ca tragi-comic time machine. It lacks an engine, goes nowhere, sits and waits.\u201d) From Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s story \u201cThe Garden of Forking Paths\u201d to TS Eliot, entropy and free will, the book is rich with associative detail.</p> <p>At first, time travel seemed a harmless fantasy, until Kurt G\u00f6del showed Albert Einstein that his equations of relativity allowed solutions in which time travel appeared to be possible, although no one yet knows exactly how. Mathematicians and physicists got to work, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet. The best argument against the possibility of time travel is probably that supplied by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/hawking\">Stephen Hawking</a>, who has pointed out that we are not invaded by hordes of tourists from the future. (Hawking posits that somehow metaphysically embedded within the universe is a \u201cChronology Protection Principle\u201d.) But that is not a knockdown argument, because many serious scientific hypotheses about time travel forbid travelling back to a time before the first time machine was invented. In that case, unfortunately, we will never be able to go back and see the dinosaurs. But also it means that we are not invaded by time travellers from the future simply because the first time machine has not yet been invented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691/0_243_1529_917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein\u2019s equations allowed solutions in which time travel appeared to be possible.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Einstein\u2019s equations allowed solutions in which time travel appeared to be possible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curiously, though, Gleick does not go into much detail about the scientific work on time travel of the last few decades, because he is convinced that physicists working on the subject have just read too much science fiction (they have, he condescendingly writes, been \u201cunwittingly conditioned\u201d by it), and are wasting their own and everyone else\u2019s, um, time. There is, for example, no reference at all to one of the leading such researchers, the astrophysicist J Richard Gott. (Interested readers should consult his excellent book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/time-travel.html\"><em>Time Travel in Einstein\u2019s Universe</em></a>.) On the other hand, the book expends very many pages on laborious plot summaries of more-or-less obscure time-travel fictions of the last century.</p> <p>Nor, moreover, is Gleick much impressed by what he considers the \u201cfutile\u201d philosophical writing on time that he has consulted. One example is the famous 1962 paper on fatalism by Richard Taylor, which begins: \u201cA fatalist \u2013 if there is any such \u2013 thinks he cannot do anything about the future\u201d, so it is \u201cpointless for him to deliberate about what he is going to do\u201d. This started a long and complicated argument in the philosophical literature, an unimportant footnote to which is that, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\">David Foster Wallace</a>\u2019s death, his undergraduate essay on the topic was published, along with Taylor\u2019s original paper, as <em>Fate, Time and Language,</em> in order, or so a cynic might think, to cash in on DFW\u2019s posthumous literary celebrity. Gleick here seems to have just swallowed the publisher\u2019s claim that the future novelist managed to refute Taylor wholesale. At the end of another chapter, with the air of revealing a profound truth, Gleick writes: \u201cWhat is time? Things change, and time is how we keep track.\u201d A fair response would be to ask: \u201cOK, what is change?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's intriguing that Gleick would choose to write a history of an idea that he deems not only impossible by ridiculous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What, then, is Gleick\u2019s cultural diagnosis? He argues that the persistent dream of time travel is a cultural fantasy of escaping the worries of the present, and in particular of eluding death. This is perceptive and no doubt true, but it would still be true even if time travel were in fact theoretically possible. The author, however, seems too impatient to keep an open mind on the matter.</p> <p>This is all rather baffling for any fan of Gleick\u2019s earlier, brilliant works such as <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/genius-316417.html\"><em>Genius</em></a>, his biography of Richard Feynman, and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/chaos.html\"><em>Chaos</em></a>: this writer, after all, more or less invented the modern style of mind-bending scientific non-fiction that does not talk down to its audience. <em>Time Travel</em> is written with his usual elegance, but there is something morose about it, as though, having embarked on the work, he now can\u2019t believe he is obliged to put all these supposedly clever people right about their stupid fantasies. Indeed, one ends the book intrigued mostly by the quirk of authorial psychology by which someone would choose to write a history of an idea that he is convinced is not only impossible but ridiculous.</p> <p>So I prefer the cheerier hypothesis that someone has already made the first time machine in their garage, and the widespread adoption of the technology is going to lead to utter disaster. Luckily, there is a hero who will stop this happening: future James Gleick, who has travelled back in time to smash the time machine he emerges from and write this book to convince everybody that there\u2019s no point ever trying to build another one.

To be so uniform, light rays must have reached every corner of the cosmos, otherwise some regions would be cooler and more dense than others. But even moving at 1bn km/h, light was not travelling fast enough to spread so far and even out the universe\u2019s temperature differences.<br /></p> <p>To overcome the conundrum, cosmologists including Stephen Hawking have proposed a theory called inflation, in which the fledgling universe underwent the briefest spell of the most tremendous expansion. According to inflation, the temperature of the cosmos evened out before it exploded to an enormous size. But there is no solid proof that inflation is right, and if so, what sparked such a massive period of expansion, and what brought it to an end.<br /></p> <p>Magueijo and Afshordi\u2019s theory does away with inflation and replaces it with a variable speed of light. According to their calculations, the heat of universe in its first moments was so intense that light and other particles moved at infinite speed. Under these conditions, light reached the most distant pockets of the universe and made it look as uniform as we see it today. \u201cIn our theory, if you go back to the early universe, there\u2019s a temperature when everything becomes faster. The speed of light goes to infinity and propagates much faster than gravity,\u201d Afshordi said. \u201cIt\u2019s a phase transition in the same way that water turns into steam.\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/07/new-simulation-dark-energy-expansion-of-universe-einstein\">New simulation could shed light on dark energy and expansion of the universe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scientists could soon find out whether light really did outpace gravity in the early universe. The theory predicts a clear pattern in the density variations of the early universe, a feature measured by what is called the \u201cspectral index\u201d. Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.101301\">Physical Review</a>, the scientists predict a very precise spectral index of 0.96478, which is close to the latest, though somewhat rough, measurement of 0.968.</p> <p>Science can never prove the theory right. But Afshordi said that if measurements over the next five years shifted the spectral index away from their prediction, it would rule out their own theory. \u201cIf we are right then inflation is wrong. But the problem with inflation is that you can always fine tune it to fit anything you want,\u201d he said.</p> <p>David Marsh, of the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at Cambridge University, is not giving up on inflation yet. \u201cThe predictions of inflation developed by Stephen Hawking and others more than 30 years ago have been tested by cosmological observations and faced those tests remarkably well. Many scientists regard inflation as a simple and elegant explanation of the origin of galaxies in the universe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And while other theories might also look promising, Marsh said there were elements of Afshordi and Magueijo\u2019s that were not well understood. \u201cIt remains to be seen how robust the predictions are when all the theoretical issues have been addressed,\u201d he said. </p>",

I\u2019m excited by <a href=\"http://www.forensic-architecture.org/\" title=\"\">Forensic Architecture</a>, an interdisciplinary group based at Goldsmiths College in London, which includes artists, journalists, architects, film-makers, lawyers, data analysts and activists.</p> <p>Forensic Architecture is the name of the research group as well as an investigative practice that crosses fields. It is grounded in the use of architecture as an \u201coptical device\u201d, employing forms of spatial analysis, mapping and reconstruction, overlaid with witness testimony and visual documentation. The group has undertaken a series of investigations into human rights violations and acts of state and corporate violence that have informed military, parliamentary and UN inquiries.</p> <p>At the same time, <a href=\"http://mthvn.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Metahaven</a>, a Dutch design studio, deals with information democracy and corporate identity. Its most recent work, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs7NFbE2NS8\" title=\"\">The Sprawl</a>, considered the \u201cways in which fantasy can be designed so as to seem or feel like a truth \u2026 how propaganda multiplies within that upload/download architecture; an architecture in which both fact and fiction can exist side by side and even overlap\u201d.</p> <p>These groups are, in many ways, the contemporary version of the Independent Group, a collection of radical young artists, writers and critics who in the 1950s called the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) their home. And if the groups look similar, then this is because the struggles are too.</p> <p><a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/profile-stefan-kalmar\" title=\"\"><em>Stefan Kalm\u00e1r</em></a><em>, a former Turner prize judge, is the director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts </em></p> <h2><strong>Politics: Ed Miliband</strong></h2> <h2>EMBRACE THE IDEALISM OF THE YOUNG</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a74a8e29f77029328f620f437269ff09ce99db9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a74a8e29f77029328f620f437269ff09ce99db9/0_109_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration at Downing Street against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As has been proved in previous generations, young people\u2019s vision can lead to long-term change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A major reason to be cheerful in politics in 2018, and for years to come, is young people. Amid the gloom that has hung over politics and society since Brexit and Trump, young people have represented the most noticeable countervailing force. We saw it this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/09/young-people-spoken-jeremy-corbyn-social-media\" title=\"\">at the general election</a>, and we have seen it in the waves of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/biggest-victories-trump-resistance\" title=\"\">young people engaged in the anti-Trump movement</a>, the #MeToo campaign and much else.</p> <p>The significance lies not just in another set of people demanding progressive things, but a set of people with a new set of demands, unencumbered by the past and driven by the circumstances of today. People born after the fall of the Berlin Wall, for many of whom LGBT+ rights, a new wave of feminism, the fight against climate change and an openness to radicalism are part of their generational DNA. When they look at the mess previous generations have made, they are driven to this desire for something better. Our deeply unequal world, including inequality between generations, is turbocharging this movement, which is not scared to demand big change.</p> <p>Their idealism will often be dismissed as naivety or worse, as every wave is always dismissed, including the 1960s wave of feminism and anti-war sentiment. But older generations should resist the \u201cwe know better\u201d impulse, the tendency to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/centrist-dad-labour-corbyn-neoliberal\" title=\"\">being a \u201ccentrist dad\u201d</a> as the term goes. Of course, this idealism is not always right, but its spirit is essential, and the demand it embodies for a new, fairer, more equal society should be embraced.</p> <p>Pessimism and cynicism achieve nothing. By contrast, the energy and vitality of this new generation can help defeat Trump and lead us to build a post-Brexit Britain that doesn\u2019t float off into a low-wage, offshore tax haven.</p> <p>Just as the causes of earlier generations of young people, once dismissed as outlandish and radical, eventually became mainstream, so too it can happen again. They are the best hope for the transformation of the country we are to the country we can become.</p> <p><em>Ed Miliband MP is a former leader of the Labour party and co-presenter of the </em><a href=\"http://cheerful.libsyn.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Reasons to be Cheerful podcast</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Biology<em>: </em>Jim Smith</strong></h2> <h2>INDIVIDUAL GENE SEQUENCING WILL TRANSFORM HEALTH</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88442bcdc3dbc237ea9851cc6fbe5ddb0d56c6b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88442bcdc3dbc237ea9851cc6fbe5ddb0d56c6b6/0_100_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A collection of blood samples\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2018 will see advances in DNA sequencing thanks to samples from UK Biobank volunteers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What we are is determined by our genes and by the sequence of the four chemicals \u2013 nucleotides \u2013 that make up the strands of our DNA. Fifteen years ago scientists sequenced and mapped the DNA in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/04/learned-to-read-genes-now-start-writing-them\" title=\"\">the human genome</a>: they determined the order of the three billion nucleotides that make up our genetic material and they established (roughly) what the different parts of the genome do.</p> <p>That has been extraordinarily powerful in helping us understand how life works and what it is to be human. But to say we have sequenced \u201cthe\u201d human genome is misleading. Our genomes are all different, and if we are to understand susceptibilities to disease, or how people will respond to certain treatments, we need to correlate the health of individual people with their individual DNA sequences.</p> <p>2018 should see this begin to happen. Thanks to advances in DNA sequencing technologies, and contributions from private sources, government and charities, it is now feasible to read the precise DNA sequence in every volunteer recruited to <a href=\"http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Biobank</a>. Set up 10 years ago, UK Biobank represents a cohort of half a million people between 40 and 69, all of whom contribute information about diet, activity, body measurements and other personal information, as well as samples of blood, urine and saliva. Participants have agreed to have their health monitored, and approved researchers from academia and industry have access to all the anonymised data.</p> <p>Already UK Biobank has transformed our understanding of health and disease, improving diagnosis and care for those with cancer and rare diseases. But if every participant has their genome sequenced, the prospects for understanding and treating disease, including obesity and mental health disorders, will be extraordinary. We do not know what we will find, but we can be confident it will transform our understanding of what it is to be healthy and what it is to be sick.</p> <p><em>Dr Jim Smith is a developmental biologist and the director of science at </em><a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Wellcome</em></a><em>, the science and health foundation</em></p> <h2><strong>Infrastructure: Sadie Morgan</strong></h2> <h2>TIME TO BUILD PRIDE IN OUR ROADS AND RAILWAYS</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ebf98be07373c71eb56970faa2afc56651f36d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebf98be07373c71eb56970faa2afc56651f36d6/0_125_3559_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ouse Valley viaduct in Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ouse Valley viaduct in Sussex is a striking example of Britain\u2019s built heritage.

We can say the same about the design of our infrastructure and how it affects people and place. It rarely gets the attention it deserves.</p> <p>As architects and designers our focus has been on buildings at the expense of everything else. We can all think of our favourite building, but can you name a great streetscape, road junction or railway viaduct? That\u2019s because often what defines the infrastructure of our countryside and cities is the miles of security fences, concrete noise barriers and railway stanchions.</p> <p>Reimagining our built environment is one of the greatest opportunities we have to put a healthier, more compassionate and greener philosophy into place.</p> <p>From stations to bridges, roads to railways, electricity pylons to flood defences,our infrastructure should engender national pride and a sense of local ownership. Look to the past, and there are plenty of great examples from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/nov/06/brunel-hs2-debate-rail\" title=\"\">Brunel\u2019s bridges</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/04/story-cities-14-london-great-stink-river-thames-joseph-bazalgette-sewage-system\" title=\"\">Bazalgette\u2019s sewers</a> and pumping stations to power stations reimagined for the 21st century, as in Battersea and Bankside, now Tate Modern.</p> <p>The UK consistently nurtures some of the best engineering, technical and architectural minds in the world, but we are building it elsewhere.</p> <p>The good news is that big projects such as HS2 \u2013 the largest infrastructure project in the UK for a decade \u2013 has committed to high-quality design from the outset.</p> <p>Britain has proved it is capable of designing and building world-class infrastructure.

By November this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/14/post-brexit-vote-surge-uk-inflation-may-have-peaked-3-percent\" title=\"\">it was running at 4.2%</a>, a third higher than the headline rate.</p> <p>In 2018 it is only going to get worse: the price of food will continue to rise ahead of general inflation, and as a weakened pound makes exporting ever more attractive, the major retailers will find themselves locked in competition with international markets for produce. Expect to see the big four supermarkets \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 softening up their customers for higher prices. Meanwhile, the discounters, especially Aldi and Lidl, which keep prices low by restricting choice but buying in enormous volume, will flourish.</p> <p>The optimistic view is that this should all be good for food producers in 2018. In reality, Britain\u2019s farmers have rarely benefited from competition among retailers, which have always prioritised shareholders over suppliers. What\u2019s more, farmers have their own price issues. Few food items are the result of a solely domestic supply chain. They depend on inputs \u2013 seedlings for fruit growing, for example, or animal feeds \u2013 from abroad and the prices of those have also risen. More pressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/21/brexit-coming-food-crisis-seasonal-migrant-labour-eu\" title=\"\">are the accelerating labour issues</a>. British agriculture depends on migrant labour, and there is increasing evidence of a reluctance to come to work here, both because the wages are worth less when sent home, and a growing perception that Britain is a less welcoming place for workers from abroad.</p> <p>This is all going to be felt most keenly in the restaurant sector, which is preparing itself for a brutal 2018. Those ingredient price rises, combined with increased business rates, a shortage of vital staff from abroad and a general softening in consumer confidence, are expected to result in many restaurants going bust. For Britain\u2019s food industry the next 12 months are not expected to be kind.</p> <p><em>Jay Rayner is Observer restaurant critic</em></p> <h2><strong>Space:</strong><em> </em><strong>Maggie Aderin-Pocock</strong></h2> <h2>GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WILL CHANGE ASTRONOMY</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"682ffa7ac3d773cdf54a609acfa25550eba11f88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682ffa7ac3d773cdf54a609acfa25550eba11f88/0_173_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Advances in the understanding of space can be traced back to Einstein and other pioneers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Advances in the understanding of space can be traced back to Einstein and other pioneers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A.

Within it, mass causes distortions in spacetime and this manifests itself as gravity (you may have seen this shown as a distortion of a rubber sheet). A gravitational wave is formed when two or more super massive objects collide, resulting in ripples in spacetime that, like ripples on a pond, expand outwards into space.</p> <p>Einstein published his theory in 1916, but it would take another hundred years, until 2016, for the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\" title=\"\">confirmed detection of a gravitational wave</a>. Why did it take so long?</p> <p>The challenge was that these ripples are minuscule. The measurement needed is the equivalent of detecting a movement of 1mm over the distance between us and Alpha Centauri (our neighbouring star about 25 trillion miles away). It sounds impossible, but the gravitational wave has a very distinct signature that can now be detected.</p> <p>The joy of this is that it gives us a whole new way of doing astronomy. For thousands of years observations with the eye, telescopes, photographic plates and digital detectors all relied on detecting electromagnetic waves \u2013 one of the few things that can travel through the vacuum of space.</p> <p>Ligo (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) can now make these challenging detections and is now fully operational after a big refurbishment. And with five confirmed gravitational wave detections in the past 18 months, we are gaining momentum \u2013 many more exotic collisions should be detected in 2018. A whole new field of astronomy is being established, and it all stems from Einstein\u2019s genius.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/21/maggie-aderin-pocock-interview-bbc-nasa-space\" title=\"\"><em>Maggie Aderin-Pocock</em></a><em> is a space scientist and honorary research associate in University College London\u2019s department of physics and astronomy</em></p> <h2><strong>Equality: Sophie Walke</strong>r<br />WOMEN MUST BE AT THE HEART OF A FAIRER FUTURE</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e7f7f14f27f0a90a4754c5b8652510dc0d2d3d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e7f7f14f27f0a90a4754c5b8652510dc0d2d3d9/0_73_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women in the US demonstrating against Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">100 years after women won the right to vote in Britain, the battle for equality is being waged worldwide.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ZUMA Wire/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Politicians could make 2018 the year that women matter, not by talking about equality but by creating it.

If Brexit is the process of remaking our relationship with the world, women must be at the negotiating table.

I can see sweeping love stories that take us away from the Twitter rages of world leaders (Ruth Jones of <em>Gavin and Stacey</em> fame and Jojo Moyes have new books out early in 2018), complex thrillers that take us closer to how the world works (<em>McMafia</em> on BBC1 from 1 January is taken from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/06/society\" title=\"\">Misha Glenny\u2019s book</a> on the links between international crime and business), and fantastical stories to transport us (Harvill\u2019s big debut, <em>The Mermaid &amp; Mrs Hancock</em> by Imogen Hermes Gowar).</p> <p>Added to this, the Weinstein earthquake and its inability to swallow Trump will result in a new narrative conversation. In the 80s and 90s, movies such as <em>Fatal Attraction</em>, <em>Basic Instinct</em> and <em>Disclosure</em> emerged from Hollywood\u2019s sense of a perceived threat posed by a new working female population, and I suspect Hollywood will find a way to give voice to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/21/we-created-the-metoo-movement-now-its-time-for-hertoo\" title=\"\">the #MeToo movement</a>. I also believe one response to \u201cpopulism\u201d will be detailed and specific stories of human struggle, filled with nuance, complexity and ambiguity. Most of all, the huge diversity of voices in Britain that have been waiting to be heard will find a place in the mainstream, and as we move away from continental Europe politically and economically, we will find expression in the bigger questions and multifarious voices in this country.</p> <p><em>Jonny Geller is a writer, book agent and joint chief executive of Curtis Brown</em></p>",

These are then filled with the required drug or vaccine and allowed to dry. </p> <p>A lid, made from the same polymer, is then lined up on top of each micro-box and the system is briefly heated to seal it and prevent the drug or vaccine from leaking out.</p> <p>When injected into the body, the boxes remain sealed until the polymer disintegrates \u2013 an event which occurs rapidly, with the timing dependant on the makeup of the polymer itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/vaccine-box-zip/giv-3902UosM33cns6bv/\" data-alt=\"vaccine graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/09/vaccine-box-zip/giv-3902UosM33cns6bv/\">vaccine graphic</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s novel here is that the sharpness of how quickly the drug releases from the particle and the fact there is no leakage at all from the particle until [then],\u201d said Jaklenec.</p> <p>To test the approach, the team injected mice with microparticles made from one of three different polymers, each filled with a fluorescent substance. Using imaging techniques, the fluorescent substance was seen to be released at about nine days, 20 days or 41 days, depending on the polymer used.</p> <p>The team also produced microparticles filled with a polio vaccine and exposed them to an antibody test to see if the vaccine\u2019s potency was affected by the heat sealing: no such problem was detected. </p> <p>Finally, mice were injected with two sets of microparticles made from different polymers \u2013 one designed to break down after about one week and the other after about five weeks \u2013 with both containing a protein found in egg white. The animals\u2019 immune response was tracked for 16 weeks. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The results reveal that the filled microparticles triggered a response greater than two regular injections of the same dose of protein spaced four weeks apart.

          "body": "<p>Long before homo sapiens was up on its hind legs, two black holes \u2013 each more massive than two dozen suns \u2013 were swirling around each other in outer space at a colossal rate. They merged with such violence that the very fabric of space and time shook, the ripples spreading out across the universe.</p> <p>A little more than a billion years later, in the early hours of 14 September 2015, some of those ripples were detected by scientists in the US. By any standards, this was a truly remarkable achievement. The astronomers had managed to identify a disturbance that had lasted only 20 milliseconds \u2013 much briefer than the blink of an eye \u2013 and was smaller than a millionth of the width of an atom. They had found the first direct evidence of gravitational waves, a feat likely to be rewarded soon with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nobelprizes\">Nobel prize</a>.</p> <p>In <em>Ripples in Spacetime</em>, the Dutch astronomy journalist Govert Schilling gives us a lively and readable account of the waves\u2019 discovery. They had first appeared in the mind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Albert Einstein</a> almost a century before, after he deduced their existence from his new theory of gravity. For reasons that Schilling does not make entirely clear, Einstein twice doubted that the waves existed but was eventually convinced that they should be part of nature\u2019s fabric.</p> <p>Einstein apparently did not spend much time contemplating the possibility of discerning these waves. This was probably because, according to his theory, they interact so feebly with ordinary matter that they would be almost certainly impossible to detect in the foreseeable future. Theorists later calculated that it might just be possible to detect them, presumably emitted in the aftermath of violent collisions between massive, compact objects in outer space. Schilling spends a good deal of time making sure that we understand all this. \u201cBuckle up for a crash course in astrophysics,\u201d he tells us, before delivering a clear, pacy narrative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f16ec4453c9f711f0286ad952794de16c1b11b9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f16ec4453c9f711f0286ad952794de16c1b11b9d/0_130_4399_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a 2016 press conference in Washington a screen shows gravitational waves that scientists observed with the Ligo detector.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a 2016 press conference in Washington a screen shows gravitational waves that scientists observed with the Ligo detector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Astronomers detected a distur\u00adbance that was smaller than a millionth of the width of an atom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All great scientific discoveries open up new lines of research, and pose more questions than answers. This one is no different. Schilling underlines that this discovery is the opening of a new window on the universe, the beginning of a new branch of science. Astronomers will no longer be limited to observing space through the waves of electricity and magnetism (for example, visible light) entering telescopes, but will be able to observe it through waves of gravity. Galileo would have been amazed.</p> <p>The design of the huge apparatus that first detected the waves exploits the fact that when the waves pass through, its<strong> </strong>dimensions are minutely altered. The change is much too small to see directly, even using the most powerful microscope. Calculations showed, however, that it should be possible to measure the change by exploiting the extremely subtle interference between beams of light from lasers. Hence the acronym Ligo, short for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.</p> <p>The Ligo authorities built two identical observatories, one in Hanford, Washington State, in the US, and the other over 3,000km away, in Livingston, Louisiana. This doubling-up enabled experimenters at the observatories to check each other\u2019s results \u2013 if only one of them appeared to detect the waves, no one would have believed it. As Ligo\u2019s director later said, it was \u201ctruly a scientific moonshot\u201d.</p> <p>Plans for detecting gravitational waves began to take shape in 1960, five years after Einstein\u2019s death. Several scientists contributed innovative ideas, but, according to Schilling, Ligo was the brainchild of three scientists: the Scot Ronald Drever, and the Americans Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss. The US National Science Foundation bankrolled the enterprise, conceived, built and operated by the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Valuable contributions were made by a few other leading academic institutions (some in the UK), but most kept their distance, deeming the project too speculative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2718d783e0ca539c288a589963108c4190efe884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2718d783e0ca539c288a589963108c4190efe884/0_248_850_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Ligo Livingston Laboratory in Louisiana.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of Ligo Livingston Laboratory in Louisiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LIGO.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Schilling expertly guides us through the development of the venture, highlighting the personal clashes and technical problems that put it in jeopardy. By the early 1990s, it was in deep trouble. The brilliantly inventive Drever was thrown off the team and even found himself locked out of his office. Two years later, the project\u2019s principal investigator was replaced by the experienced experimentalist Barry Barish, who put it back on the rails. He later described the authorities\u2019 agreement to continue to fund it after 1994, despite an alarming hike in the budget, as \u201ca miracle\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Schilling expertly guides us through the\u00a0venture, showing the personal clashes and problems that put it in jeopardy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By 2015, about 1,000 scientists and engineers were working on the project, which had racked up a cost of more than $1bn. But it was suddenly all worth it. Astronomers detected a tiny disturbance that clearly signalled the discovery of gravitational waves, emitted by merging black holes exactly as Einstein\u2019s theory had predicted. The gravitational waves emitted in this single collision had a power that was much greater than the output of all the stars in the universe combined.</p> <p>The Ligo officials announced the discovery almost five months later. The science had to be watertight. A few years before, astronomers working on another project had rushed to announce the sensational discovery of gravitational waves formed early in the universe, but the evidence \u2013 splashed across front pages all over the world \u2013 turned out to be a handful of dust.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/22/hunt-is-on-gravity-waves-spacewatch\">The hunt is on for gravity waves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In decades to come, Ligo and other detectors will be able to monitor bursts of gravitational waves with ever-increasing precision. The team has already detected them from a few other black hole mergers, and waves emitted from mergers between these and other exotic cosmic objects are expected to be commonplace in the near future.</p> <p>Yet all this depends on maintaining adequate funding for basic research.

If the gravity waves discovery is awarded the Nobel prize in physics on 3 October, it will be interesting to see whether it will, in keeping with tradition, be shared among a maximum of three scientists.

One doesn\u2019t have to be Einstein to work out that 14 gallons of semen would require 12,740 ejaculations of five millilitres volume (the oft-quoted average). This would mean an average of just over four ejaculations per week, every week for a 60-year period (or five per week over 50 years, etc), say from early teens to early seventies.

Goya may even have intended it as an allegory of the season, for it is a design for a tapestry to hang in the Spanish royal palace El Pardo, part of a series of such designs that were his first major commissions. The young Goya\u2019s brightly coloured tapestry designs rejoice in (apparently) simple evocations of seasonal fun and festivals, like this portrayal of a country doctor warming his hands over a dish of hot coals while his two students huddle by him in the bleak midwinter. The fiery red of the doctor\u2019s cloak contrasts brilliantly with a stark leafless tree behind him, while warm russet faces look out of the picture with a glow of winter cheer. This is an optimistic painting. It is not only an evocation of winter but of reason. Goya believed fervently in the scientific ideals of the European Enlightenment, which held that education and technology could improve life. When he painted this early work there were real hopes of the Enlightenment spreading to Spain. This doctor can stand the cold because he is warmed by reason, in the shape of the medical books that lie open in front of him. Goya would later see reason destroyed by war and smothered by superstition but in this heartwarming work he expresses his hope for humanity.<br />\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/4978/el-m%C3%A9dico-doctor\">Scottish National Gallery</a>, Edinburgh.</p> <h2>Image of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143313ffede0b1823ade0fe6fdbae8af7f0b39a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/143313ffede0b1823ade0fe6fdbae8af7f0b39a9/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dubai Frame in Zabeel Park, Dubai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/01/dubai-frame-uaes-latest-surreal-landmark-frames-a-controversy\">The Dubai Frame</a> <br /></strong>The world\u2019s largest picture frame has been unveiled in Dubai.

This helped him (and us!) get to grips with the formidably complex ideas and their consequences. </p> <p> It takes a truly creative imagination to come up with these thought experiments and they\u2019ve always reminded me of short stories, so when I realised that the 100th anniversary of general relativity would fall in November last year, I thought that a suitable celebration of Einstein\u2019s achievement might be an anthology of specially commissioned short stories. It also felt appropriate that this sort of celebration - through the medium of literature rather than science - would be somewhat outside the scientific orthodoxy - as was Einstein himself for much of his career.</p> <p> I approached a number of writers who were very enthusiastic and keen to explore the subject in a creative way. And we were very pleased to get backing for the project from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (the research council that funds astronomy in the UK) \u2013 they clearly recognise that stories about science are a good way of reaching out to the public.</p> <h2><strong>What can fiction bring to science?</strong></h2> <p>Science is too often a closed book for many people, they study it at school and are bored by it, or find it difficult or irrelevant to their lives. But fiction has this incredible ability to reflect and examine all aspects of the real world, and writing fiction about science is a great way of opening it up to new audiences, and helping to demystify it.</p> <p> Science is also heavily reliant on literary concepts, such as metaphors, to get its points across; we often hear the phrases \u2018the Universe is like an expanding balloon\u2019, or \u2018DNA is like an alphabet\u2019. So I think fiction and science have more in common with each other than may first appear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8be3cdca6803693190c47f963610cece79bdcf79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8be3cdca6803693190c47f963610cece79bdcf79/0_0_686_858/400.jpg\" alt=\"Former astronomer turned author Pippa Goldschmidt\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former astronomer turned author Pippa Goldschmidt will collect a \u2018Suffrage Science\u2019 award tonight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Goldschmidt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Does fiction about science have to be more about the scientists rather than science?</strong></p> <p>The challenge in writing about science lies in developing a story which can appeal to emotions as well as intellect. I think in particular it is difficult to write a story about physical sciences (as opposed to the life sciences) that is able to do that, because the subject matter is necessarily more removed from the human experience. It\u2019s tricky to place particle physics or cosmology centre stage in your story \u2013 not impossible, but more difficult than, say, writing about genetics or medicine. So it\u2019s easier to appeal to readers if you bring in the human element \u2013 the story of the scientists themselves as well as their work.</p> <p>The science has to be worked into the story so it helps drive forward the plot, it has to be more than a decoration.</p> <h2><strong>Is science the new history when it comes to fiction?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, I think it could be. One example of fiction about a difficult historical subject which has helped to convey that subject to a huge number of readers is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s novel <em>Half of a Yellow Sun</em>, focusing on a group of Nigerian people and their experiences of the Biafran war. I love that novel and yet I really doubt I would have picked up a non-fiction account of that event. </p> <p> Historical fiction is rightly popular because it brings to life distant people and times and helps us understand them, and their influence on us. Fiction about science can do the same thing, because it\u2019s ideally suited to investigating the inner lives of characters, showing what they think and feel, what motivates them, how they react to external circumstances, how they adapt to new challenges and cope with pressures and conflicts.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Because-You-are-Celebrating-Relativity/dp/1910449261\">I Am Because You Are, An Anthology of Stories Celebrating the Centenary of the General Theory of Relativity</a></em> is edited by Pippa Goldschmidt and Tania Hershman (Freight Books).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/\"><em>Stuart Clark</em></a><em> is the author of </em><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skys-Dark-Labyrinth-Trilogy-Book/dp/1846972159/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457365145&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+SKy%27s+Dark+Labyrinth\">The Sky\u2019s Dark Labyrinth </a></em><em> trilogy (Polygon), and co-host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.acast.com/stuniverse\"><em>The Stuniverse</em></a><em> (</em><em>Bingo Productions</em><em>).</em></p>",

          "body": "<h2>The Durrells <br />8pm, ITV</h2> <p>A second series of the charming comedy-drama adapted from Gerald Durrell\u2019s Corfu Trilogy. Gerry\u2019s brothers have decided to grow moustaches; mum Louisa (Keeley Hawes) unexpectedly wakes up next to a sheep \u2013 although new arrival Hugh Jarvis (Daniel Lapaine), a dashing farmer, would much rather she woke up beside him instead; and boy-crazy Margo has decided she wants to become a nun. Meanwhile, an ecstatic Gerry has discovered some otter droppings \u2026 <em>Ali Catterall</em> </p> <h2>Bigheads <br />7pm, ITV</h2> <p>The ghost of It\u2019s a Knockout haunts this strange new gameshow, where members of the public try to complete physical tasks while lumbering around wearing grotesque likenesses of Trump, Adele, Mo Farah and even Einstein. The games typically involve either falling down or being knocked over, providing fitful, mindless entertainment. Jason Manford hosts, but the real energy comes from Jenny Powell and Kriss Akabusi in the commentary box. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Line of Duty <br />9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>The penultimate episode of the peerless corruption drama and AC-12 are processing the implications of Hilton\u2019s recusal. As better men than Hilton have discovered, this lot are no fun when they\u2019re angry. But even so, our heroes are stretched to the limit here. And then there\u2019s DCI Huntley. Thandie Newton\u2019s performance is increasingly startling: borderline psychopathic blankness beginning to dissolve into something more fragile and, accordingly, more dangerous. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Grantchester <br />9pm, ITV</h2> <p>\u201cHow does a man drown in the middle of a church?\u201d Good question, and one that much concerns vicar Sidney Chambers and detective Geordie Keating as the likable, 1950s-set crime drama returns. It\u2019s an investigation that eventually leads the duo to a decidedly spooky institution. Meanwhile, Sidney\u2019s relationship with married Amanda deepens, an ongoing plot development that\u2019s echoed in the personal travails of Geordie and closeted curate Leonard Finch. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>The Island With Bear Grylls <br />9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Youth is pitted against experience in this latest series of Bear Grylls\u2019s survival challenge show. An old and a young team are marooned under the watchful eye of the Chief Scout, with 66-year-old Frank heading up the veterans while the kids are led by 18-year-old Freddie, the youngest of the lot. Perhaps predictably, while Frank\u2019s group are busy making fire, Freddie\u2019s is soon lost in the jungle suffering exhaustion and dehydration. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Genius: Einstein <br />9pm, National Geographic</h2> <p>Nat Geo\u2019s first scripted series is a bio-drama flipping between disobedient student Einstein (the magnetic Johnny Flynn) and revered but still fizzy middle-aged Einstein (Geoffrey Rush). The elder man is a Jew in Berlin as Nazism rises. An irresistible story, the more so for an unusual emphasis on Albert\u2019s personality and politics \u2013 so it survives Ron Howard\u2019s unsubtle direction and a support cast full of Brits with loose German accents. <em>Jack Seale</em><br /></p> <h2>Cyberwar <br />9pm, Viceland</h2> <p>Ben Makuch investigates Israel\u2019s growing enthusiasm for keyboard-engineered espionage with the government expanding efforts to become a cyber superpower. With military service mandatory, a stream of young Israelis keener on manipulating RAM than emulating Rambo aim for the Israeli Intelligence Agency\u2019s digital division, not least for the promise of highly paid jobs following their service. Makuch also speaks to potentially targeted Palestinians. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em><br /></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Amazing Spider-Man 2, (Marc Webb, 2014), 6.15pm, ITV2</strong><br />Among the plethora of Spider-Men, this is the one between the Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire trilogy and the upcoming Jon Watts/Tom Holland version. Still, there\u2019s undeniably a real buzz about Andrew Garfield\u2019s endearingly gawky Peter Parker-cum-web-slinger, who is wrestling with teen-love problems \u2013 girlfriend Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) dumps him \u2013 and a crackling new super villain in Jamie Foxx\u2019s Electro. <em>Paul Howlett</em><br /><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>The Sessions, (Ben Lewin, 2012), 12midnight, Channel 4</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd43e3bdffa6cb4555ada031a1ff5be3d1f2f37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd43e3bdffa6cb4555ada031a1ff5be3d1f2f37/276_0_3805_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sessions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sessions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.FoxSearch/Everett / Rex Featur</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s an awkward subject handled rather well. It\u2019s based on the true story of Mark O\u2019Brien (John Hawkes), a California poet mostly confined \u2013 by childhood polio \u2013 to an iron lung. Nearing 40, he decides it\u2019s time to lose his virginity, which leads him to sex therapist Cheryl (Helen Hunt). You couldn\u2019t call it unsentimental, but it\u2019s also well-acted, funny and sweetly moving. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><br /><strong>The Players, (Gilles Lellouche, Eric Lartigau, Michel Hazanavicius, Jean Dujardin, Alexandre Court\u00e8s, Fred Cavay\u00e9, Emmanuelle Bercot, 2012), 1.30am, Film4</strong><br />A French portmanteau movie stuffed with amour fou. The original title, Les Infid\u00e8les, better describes the antics of Jean Dujardin (Oscar-winner for the Artist) and Gilles Lellouche in a series of sketches illustrating a certain Gallic-male inability to be faithful to one\u2019s wife; for instance, one propositions women at a conference, the other is a dentist struggling in an affair with a young patient. If the aim is to make the two look ridiculous and tacky, The Players succeeds. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>World Championship Snooker</strong> More green-baize action from Sheffield. 10am, BBC2</p> <p><strong>FA Cup Football: Arsenal v Manchester City</strong> The second semi-final from Wembley Stadium. 2.30pm, BT Sport 1</p> <p><strong>IPL Cricket: Kolkata Knight Riders v Royal Challengers Bangalore</strong> Big money T20 action from Eden Gardens, Kolkata. 3pm, Sky Sports 2 </p>",

The waves, which were predicted by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3bn years for the waves to arrive at the Ligo detector in the USA. </p> <p>The signal was extremely weak when it reached Earth, but is already promising a revolution in astrophysics. Gravitational waves are an entirely new way of observing the most violent events in space and testing the limits of our knowledge.</p> <p>Ligo, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is a collaborative project with over one thousand researchers from more than twenty countries. Together, they have realised a vision that is almost fifty years old. The 2017 Nobel Laureates have, with their enthusiasm and determination, each been invaluable to the success of Ligo. Pioneers Rainer Weiss and Kip S Thorne, together with Barry C Barish, the scientist and leader who brought the project to completion, ensured that four decades of effort led to gravitational waves finally being observed.</p> <p> In the mid-1970s, Rainer Weiss had already analysed possible sources of background noise that would disturb measurements, and had also designed a detector, a laser-based interferometer, which would overcome this noise. Early on, both Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss were firmly convinced that gravitational waves could be detected and bring about a revolution in our knowledge of the universe. </p> <p>Gravitational waves spread at the speed of light, filling the universe, as Albert Einstein described in his general theory of relativity. They are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other. Einstein was convinced it would never be possible to measure them. The Ligo project\u2019s achievement was using a pair of gigantic laser interferometers to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus, as the gravitational wave passed the Earth. </p> <p>So far all sorts of electromagnetic radiation and particles, such as cosmic rays or neutrinos, have been used to explore the universe. However, gravitational waves are direct testimony to disruptions in spacetime itself. This is something completely new and different, opening up unseen worlds. A wealth of discoveries awaits those who succeed in capturing the waves and interpreting their message. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T10:30:38.440Z\">at 11.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59d3637ee4b0563a9b0f8d60\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T10:17:42.123Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MIT have a good video explaining how the Ligo detector works.

Revolving around each other, spiralling faster and faster, whirling finally at half the velocity of light, they collided and merged forming an even more massive black hole. This momentous event reverberated through space and time as gravitational waves sped outwards carrying information on what had just happened.</p> <p>This event took place about 1.3bn years ago at a time when the first multicellular life emerged on Earth. Ever since then have the gravitational wavs sped through the universe, reaching our cosmic neighbourhood, the Magellanic cloud, about 200,000 years ago when early <em>Homo sapiens</em> walked in Africa, and finally swept to the Earth on September 14th 2015 when the waves were recorded by perhaps the most sensitive instrument ever devised by man: the Ligo interferometer gravitational wave observatory.</p> <p>This event caused a sensation worldwide.

Rainer Weiss, emeritus professor at MIT, was central to designing the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) which detected the ripples in spacetime.

When massive objects merge, this curvature can be altered, sending ripples out across the universe. These are known as gravitational waves.By the time these disturbances reach us, they are almost imperceptible. It was only a century after Einstein's prediction that scientists developed a detector sensitive enough - the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory or Ligo - and were able to confirm the existence of gravitational waves.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Each of the gravitational waves had been set in motion by violent collisions between black holes more than a billion years ago. But while detecting the waves was feat enough to land the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/03/nobel-prize-physics-discovery-gravitational-waves-ligo\">Nobel prize in physics for Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne</a>, what excites astronomers now is what they stand to learn about the universe.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a story in two parts,\u201d said Sheila Rowan, director of the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow. \u201cThe first part was the quest to make these instruments sensitive enough to make the first detection, but that\u2019s the end of one story and the start of another. We are really on the threshold of a whole new way to study our universe and that\u2019s hugely exciting.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>Until now, astronomers have mapped the heavens almost exclusively with telescopes that gather light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Optical telescopes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/hubble-space-telescope\">such as Hubble</a>, have allowed scientists to gaze deep into the history of the universe, but these observations hit a hard limit at about 400,000 years after the big bang: back then, the universe was opaque to light.</p> \n<p>Gravitational waves are not so easily blocked. Although they are weak, they are hard to mask, and so future observations of the waves could allow scientists to break through the optical limit and see what the universe looked like moments after the big bang.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cAt some point, not with the detectors we have now, we hope to be able to look at the beginnings of the universe,\u201d said Rainer Weiss, the physicist at MIT who shared Tuesday\u2019s Nobel prize in physics with other members of the Ligo team. </p> \n<p>\u201cThere are calculations that indicate that the very earliest instants of the universe, right after the universe gets born, there is an enormous amount of background radiation of gravitational waves generated. That would be one of the most fascinating things man could [see] because it will tell you very much how the universe starts.\u201d<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a428d86e-805b-4c4d-997a-e687036ed6e2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVqy5WlO7pY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The earliest gravitational waves were probably emitted a fraction of a second after the big bang, when the universe went from being smooth and structureless to clumpy, at which point spacetime became \u201cbendy\u201d. </p> \n<p>Professor Andreas Freise, a Ligo project scientist at the University of Birmingham, said: \u201cOne of the mysteries is how we get from there to now where everything is clumpy.\u201d </p> \n<p>The transition is thought to have left a gravitational wave imprint on the entire universe, which might be visible with future detectors more sensitive than Ligo.</p> \n<p>There are plenty more phenomena scientists hope to spot sooner. Gravitational waves spread out from cosmic events that accelerate huge quantities of matter. This happens when a star explodes, but until now, all astronomers have seen is the bright flash of light that marks a star\u2019s death. By studying gravitational waves, scientists hope to learn for the first time what happens inside a collapsing star. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt should produce a gravitational wave signal and it\u2019s a signal that would give us information that currently we can\u2019t get any other way, because it\u2019s about what\u2019s happening inside a collapsing star,\u201d Rowan said.<br></p> \n<p>When Ligo switched on, scientists thought that the first waves they spotted were likely to come from collisions between neutron stars, some of the most exotic entities in the universe. Neutron stars form when massive stars die. They have crusts and crystalline cores and are incredibly dense: a teaspoon of neutron star weighs as much as Mount Everest.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome supernovae explode and end up as black holes, but others end up as neutron stars,\u201d said Pedro Ferreira, professor of astrophysics at Oxford University and author of the 2014 book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~pgf/Pedro_Ferreira/The_Perfect_Theory.html\">The Perfect Theory: a century of geniuses and the battle over general relativity</a>. \u201cThe thing the Ligo scientists expected to see, and might see soon, are two neutron stars orbiting each other and coming together. If you can see these events you start learning about fundamental physics, and that is pretty amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other countries, including Japan and India, have plans to build their own gravitational wave detectors. More ambitiously, the European Space Agency intends to send an observatory into space in 2034. Known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/22/hunt-is-on-gravity-waves-spacewatch\">Lisa, for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna</a>, the mission aims to detect far weaker gravitational waves than is possible on Earth.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cMany of us who were in this thing fully expect that we\u2019re going to learn things that we didn\u2019t know about,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cWe knew about black holes other ways, and we knew about neutron stars. We hope that there are all sorts of phenomena that you can see mostly because of the gravitational waves they emit. That will open a new science.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 December 2017 to correct the date Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity from 1905 to 1915.<br></p>",

As well as being a peerless scientist, he showed great wisdom and integrity \u2013 he was an outstanding humanitarian. One hundred years ago, he completed his theory of relativity, setting out a theory of gravity that would surpass Isaac <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/isaac-newton\" title=\"\">Newton</a>\u2019s and which continues to shape\u00a0our understanding of the universe today.</p> <p>Einstein had emerged 10 years earlier, apparently from nowhere, to\u00a0give the world\u2019s leading scientists a\u00a0series of physics lessons they would never forget. During his 20-year golden streak,\u00a0ending in 1925, he did more than\u00a0anyone else to reshape the understanding of space, time, energy, matter and gravity. He pioneered the crucial idea that symmetry is at the heart of fundamental laws of nature. He\u00a0could be practically minded, too: with his Hungarian friend Leo Szilard, he came\u00a0up with an innovative design for a\u00a0fridge,\u00a0which they patented\u00a0in 1930.</p> <p>Although he valued his solitude \u2013 he once said he would happily live in a\u00a0lighthouse \u2013 he was a considerate colleague and friend. His astonishing insight into nature was matched by his understanding of human affairs, and his quotations and popular essays still reward re-reading. Deeply engaged with\u00a0politics, he spoke out against hypernationalism and fought against the persecution of Jews and other minorities. His friend and colleague in the 1950s, N\u00e1ndor Bal\u00e1zs, once told me that Einstein\u2019s main weakness was his impatience with people beating a path to his door. On one occasion, a young woman travelled all the way from Bombay to Princeton, simply to talk\u00a0to\u00a0him. He reluctantly agreed, groaning:\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0suppose I have to go and play God again.\u201d When I asked Bal\u00e1zs whether Einstein was a saint, he shot back: \u201cNo, he was better than that \u2013 he\u00a0was human.\u201d</p>",

In this century-old theory, Einstein describes gravity as an invisible landscape of contours. Accelerating objects produce oscillations in this landscape, which are the gravitational waves. They propagate outwards like ripples on a pond. </p> <p>However, they are minuscule, causing disturbances of no more than a thousandth the width of an atomic nucleus. This made Einstein doubt whether they would ever be measured.</p> <p>LISA Pathfinder was supposed to take a step towards the necessary sensitivity to do this in space. However, the engineering is so good that it has virtually crossed the finish line.<br /></p> <p>At the heart of the mission are two metal cubes. Each weighs 2kg and has been hewn from a \u20ac200,000 ingot of gold-platinum alloy. Today, the European Space Agency announced that the spacecraft has succeeded in isolating these \u2018test masses\u2019 from every other force in the Universe except gravity. </p> <p>This test could not be performed on Earth because the cubes had to float freely inside the spacecraft. The position between the two cubes is measured by a laser system, which is the key to building a gravitational wave observatory in space.</p> <p>According to Fabio Favata, Head of the ESA Science Coordination Office, detecting gravitational waves is the equivalent of developing microphones for space. Until this year, all information had come from telescopes that look into the universe. </p> <p>Gravitational wave detection opens up a whole new realms to investigation. For example, colliding black holes emit no light but give out a wealth of gravitational waves. Favata said that detecting such gravitational waves was the equivalent of being in a forest and hearing the animals while not being able to see them.</p> <p>He also said that the success of the mission was only possible because of European cooperation. ESA chose Airbus in Stevenage, UK, to build the spacecraft.</p> <p>Now that LISA Pathfinder is working so well, ESA could begin building a full gravitational wave mission. This has come to be referred to generically as LISA for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). </p> <p>At the agency, the name LISA has assumed such redolence of future possibilities that ESA\u2019s Director of Science Johann-Dietrich Woerner admitted at today\u2019s press conference that he even named his first daughter after the mission.</p> <p>LISA - the mission - would detect different frequencies of gravitational waves than LIGO and other ground-based detectors. For example, from space astronomers could \u2018hear\u2019 the formation of galaxies in the early days of the Universe.</p> <p>A full LISA mission is planned for launch in 2034. It would consist of two or three identical spacecraft flying five million kilometres apart. A recent report by European experts suggested that this time frame could now be brought forward because of LISA Pathfinder\u2019s stunning success.</p> <p>But Favata warned that certain other technologies, like the laser system to communicate between the spacecraft across those millions of kilometres, needed to be developed. Once ESA was convinced that all technologies were ready, then they would green-light the mission and begin the decade-long process of building LISA.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/\"><em>Stuart Clark</em></a><em> is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Unknown-Universe-About-Chapters/dp/1781855749/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0\"><em>The Unknown Universe</em></a><em> (Head of Zeus), and co-host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.acast.com/stuniverse\"><em>The Stuniverse</em></a><em> (Bingo Productions).</em></p>",

A tricky situation for a man who reckons that making choices might be a form of arrogance, who has turned procrastination into an art form and has invented a new word \u2013 Nosey \u2013 that combines both yes and no.

He shows us some of his art, and wrestles with words and feelings. The feelings are too big and slippery to be encompassed by the words and require music to express them.

The first picture that Creed recalls seeing was a crudely drawn image of a penis in a public toilet when he was a child. Public toilets, he thinks, are a bit like art galleries: \u201cwhite, brightly lit and full of shit\u201d. He reckons he is as much of \u201ca dick\u201d as the rest of the art world. He distrusts his own success, which is of course quite different from valuing his own work.

Essentially, it\u2019s watching somebody standing in front of you with a guitar and a microphone, thinking out loud and engaging you in conversation. Creed\u2019s thoughts and murmurings veer from the inconsequential to the profound as he attempts to find the perfect alignment of words and music to express how he feels.

On an even larger scale, think of the jubilant mission control room of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/curiosity-rover\" title=\"\">Mars Curiosity rover</a>; the thousands of collaborators at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/cern\" title=\"\">Cern </a>who validated the existence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Higgs boson</a>; or the international teams that over 13 years sequenced the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\" title=\"\">human genome</a>. These stories are powerful too.</p> <p>And if we look towards some of the great challenges of our time \u2013 tackling the problem of clean and sustainable energy, providing sufficient food for a growing planet, developing new genetic technologies to improve health, or harnessing the power of the digital revolution, we start to see how difficult it will be for any one individual to take any of them on alone. The same is true for fundamental science such as understanding the working of the brain or the origin of the universe.</p> <p>Collaboration brings fresh ideas and new perspectives. Bringing people together from diverse backgrounds, often across borders, leads to new ways of thinking, better solutions and faster progress.</p> <p>We need to celebrate this collaboration more than ever, because it doesn\u2019t happen on its own. It needs an environment that encourages researchers to build international and interdisciplinary teams, to work in different countries, to attack problems that no one person, or nation, can solve alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bringing people together from diverse backgrounds leads to new ways of thinking, better thinking  and faster progress</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For 50 years, systems, often invisible, have been carefully constructed to make collaboration possible. Universities have welcomed students from their local communities, from around the country and from around the world, all of whom will lead tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs. Funding has been put in place, through the European Union and other pan-continental schemes, which fund excellence wherever it\u2019s found. And policies that allow data sharing, multi-hospital clinical trials and open access publishing of results have been implemented to ease the mechanics of science across borders.</p> <p>But this environment is fragile and uncertain. The growing political success of populist nationalism risks puts these systems and values, so carefully constructed and argued for, at risk.</p> <p>The cracks are already appearing. Travel bans mean that scientists, often from nations working hard to improve their scientific capability, increasingly cannot collaborate or take part in international meetings and projects.</p> <p>Uncertainty over eligibility for EU research funding under the \u20ac77bn research and innovation programme for 2014-2020, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/\" title=\"\">Horizon 2020</a>, after March 2019 means that scientists based in the UK have been excluded from grants, have abandoned potential collaborations or have chosen to work in a country with more certain funding options. A warmer tone, such as we saw last week from Theresa May in her Florence speech on Brexit, or, even better, a clear commitment to remaining in Horizon 2020, would remove this doubt in a stroke.</p> <p>And for climate scientists, seeing the US withdraw from the Paris climate accord has been a huge blow to progress on a problem that can only be solved with joint action.</p> <p>It\u2019s up to people who, like me, believe in the power of science to speak up for the systems and principles that make collaboration possible. It means making the case for flexible, welcoming immigration that allows the movement of talented people and teams across borders in order to take global action against global problems.</p> <p>We can also reach out to leading science nations and emerging superpowers to create better, stronger and more equal scientific partnerships. At <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Wellcome,</a> we have joined together with some of the greatest scientific institutions in the world, from <a href=\"https://www.mpg.de/en\" title=\"\">Max Planck</a>, to the <a href=\"https://aasciences.ac.ke/\" title=\"\">African Academy of Sciences</a>, to the <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, to support building these bridges.</p> <p>Together, science can, with the support of society, solve the world\u2019s most pressing challenges and make discoveries that will further our knowledge and improve our lives in ways we cannot imagine today.</p> <p>Individuals can achieve a lot, but teams can achieve much more. We are looking forward to celebrating the new Nobel laureates. But let\u2019s also celebrate the collaborators and environment that made their work possible.</p> <p><em>Jeremy Farrar is director of Wellcome.

          "body": "<p>In accepting the degree of Doctor of Science conferred on him by the University of Manchester yesterday, Professor ALBERT EINSTEIN conferred a signal honour on Manchester and its University. The compliment was no vain one on either side, for the University of Manchester claims high distinction in the scientific field, and Professor EINSTEIN\u2019S visit is in itself a very distinct recognition of the University as a home of science. </p> <p>EINSTEIN himself has become, with amazing rapidity, the hero not only of the scientist and the scholar, but also of the populace. The reason is not hard to seek. The man in the street, a traveller between life and death, is compact of all elements, and is neither wholly devoid of science nor of poetry. He may have few ideas in either, but he probably cherishes what he has, and whatever touches them nearly is of moment to him. </p> <p>Professor EINSTEIN\u2019S theory of Relativity, however vaguely he may comprehend it, disturbs fundamentally his basic conceptions of the universe and even of his own mind. It challenges somehow the absolute nature of his thought. The very idea that he can use his mind in a disinterested way is assailed by a conception which gives partiality to every perception. And with this keen thrust at personal things, the idea of Relativity stretches out to the very conceptions of the universe, as can be seen from the mere titles of the closing chapters in Professor EINSTEIN\u2019S little book on the subject. </p> <p> Definite ideas emerge, even, on the shape of the universe itself, and the finite and the infinite are made to lie down comfortably together by deductions from the relativity of our daily observations. Everything, it has been said, assimilates to the nature of music. Professor EINSTEIN is a musician in his leisure moments, and his science seems to bear some relation to that art, in which everything is thought of in terms of movement and relation, and the fixed only as something arbitrary.<br /></p>",

The book made waves upon publication in the early 1990s and became in effect a handbook for non-violent revolt.</p> <p>It has been translated, often by activists themselves, into dozens of languages and cited directly in many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/28/angola-jails-17-activists-rebellion-public-book-reading\">grassroots</a> uprisings and protests. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/angola-book-club-dos-santos-arrests\">Reading the revolution: the book club that terrified the Angolan regime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The retired professor believed fervently in the power of ordinary people to disempower dictators, motivating resistance leaders in the face of fear and violence with the idea that bullies ultimately could not rule if the masses withheld their support.</p> <p>His death, at his home in Boston on Sunday, was confirmed on Tuesday by Jamila Raqib, the executive director of the Albert Einstein Institution he founded in Massachusetts in 1983.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having a lot of difficulty adequately putting into words what he meant to me and to the world. I\u2019ve been observing an outpouring at the news of Gene\u2019s passing and I think many people are reflecting on the profound effect he had on their thinking and their approaches to the massive challenges in life,\u201d Raqib told the Guardian on Tuesday.</p> <p>She said she had been looking back at Sharp\u2019s early writing from his teens and into the 1950s.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a dark world: the rise of totalitarianism, atomic weapons, the struggle against racial injustice, and he found there was not one cure, a super-solution, for oppression. He collected the wisdom of thousands of years of people fighting oppression,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Raqib said Sharp was less an activist than an intellectual and an advocate. But his passion in empowering the grassroots with the belief that people could rebel successfully using non-violent means enraged dictators from Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and authorities from Russia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/angola-book-club-dos-santos-arrests\">Angola</a>.

He never won it but received many other prizes and awards for his work.</p> <p>The British journalist and film-maker Ruaridh Arrow, who made a documentary about Sharp and the drive behind Dictatorship to Democracy in 2012, said Sharp was painfully aware that resistance could cost lives.</p> <p>\u201cYou will sustain casualties, but fewer casualties than if you resort to violence. And non-violent action can make the transition to democracy easier. Sharp examined the models and strategies of titans of non-violence and basically put it in a manual,\u201d Arrow told the Guardian.</p> <p>Arrow\u2019s documentary about Sharp, How to Start a Revolution, was about to be released when the Arab Spring, the series of popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/23/arab-spring-five-years-on-writers-look-back\">uprisings</a> across parts of north Africa and the Middle East that began in Tunisia in 2011, took place. </p> <p>Arrow recently completed Sharp\u2019s authorized biography, which is due to be published in the US and the UK some time this spring.</p> <p>He said that Sharp admired icons such as Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King Jr and many others but he did not so much argue for the moral values of non-violent resistance as the sheer pragmatism and effectiveness of it. Sharp argued that that could mean the masses all staying at home, refusing to participate in a society\u2019s everyday functioning.</p> <p>Sharp served time in prison for civil disobedience. He refused to carry his draft card and submit to conscription to fight in the Korean war. He was born in Ohio and studied at Ohio State and Oxford universities, later becoming a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Sharp\u2019s first book, Gandhi Wields the Weapon of Modern Power: Three Case Histories, was published in 1960.</p>",

In new research, scientists report signature patterns of neural activity that mark out those who are most creative.</p> <p>\u201cWe have identified a pattern of brain connectivity that varies across people, but is associated with the ability to come up with creative ideas,\u201d said Roger Beaty, a psychologist at Harvard University. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can predict with perfect accuracy who\u2019s going to be the next Einstein, but we can get a pretty good sense of how flexible a given person\u2019s thinking is.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/07/thinking-caps-on-electrical-currents-boost-creative-problem-solving-study-finds\">Suppressing the reasoning part of the brain stimulates creativity, scientists find</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Creative thinking is one of the primary drivers of cultural and technological change, but the brain activity that underpins original thought has been hard to pin down. In an effort to shed light on the creative process, Beaty teamed up with colleagues in Austria and China to scan people\u2019s brains as they came up with original ideas.<br /></p> <p>The scientists asked the volunteers to perform a creative thinking task as they lay inside a brain scanner. While the machine recorded their white matter at work, the participants had 12 seconds to come up with the most imaginative use for an object that flashed up on a screen. Three independent scorers then rated their answers.<br /></p> <p>One of the barriers to creative thinking is the ease with which common, unoriginal thoughts swamp the mind. Some people in the study could not get past these. For example, when asked for creative uses for a sock, soap and chewing gum wrapper, less creative people gave answers such as \u201ccovering the feet\u201d, \u201cmaking bubbles\u201d and \u201ccontaining gum\u201d respectively. For the same items, more original thinkers suggested a water filtration system, a seal for envelopes, and an antenna wire.</p> <p>Reported in the <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1713532115\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, the study found distinct patterns of brain activity in the most and least creative people. In the highly original thinkers, the scientists saw strong connectivity between three networks of the brain. One, known as the default mode network, is linked to spontaneous thinking and mind wandering, while a second, the executive control network, is engaged when people focus in on their thoughts. The third, called the salience network, helps to work out what best deserves our attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/20/how-brain-freestyles-music\">Making it up as you go along: how your brain improvises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first two of these three brain networks tend to work against one another, Beaty said, each dampening the other down. But the scans suggest that more creative people can better engage both networks at once. \u201cIt might be easier for creative thinkers to bring these resources to bear simultaneously,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Initial scans on men and women from the University of North Carolina were backed up by further scans in Austrian and Chinese volunteers. To make sure enough creative people took part in the study, the researchers recruited plenty of artists, musicians and scientists. Now, Beaty wants to look at brain activity in different creative pursuits, such as the arts and sciences, and investigate whether training helps boost creative powers.</p> <p>In 2016, David Melcher, who studies creativity at the University of Trento, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39185\">identified brain networks used in visual art</a>. \u201cA critical open question, for future research, is whether this ability to put the brain in creative mode transfers across tasks,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we learn to network our brain regions for creativity in new domains once we learn to do it, for example, in painting or freestyle rap?\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cThere has been an educational policy, in many countries including the US, of reducing teaching hours in the arts and focusing instead on rote learning for yearly testing of basic knowledge,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to understand whether creativity is a transferable skill, a way of using the brain that students learn to use across fields.\u201d<br /></p>",

James later took his mother\u2019s maiden name as a stage name. He went to Sedbergh school, Cumbria, and then Trinity College, Oxford, to study modern languages, graduating in 1961. He did a brief stint as a junior reporter on the Harrogate Advertiser, then went to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London (1963-66).</p> <p>After honing his craft in repertory theatre across the country, from Falmouth to Dundee (1966-71), James spent six years with the Orchard theatre in north Devon before returning to London. There he was in many productions, including Pericles at the <a href=\"http://www.stratfordeast.com/\" title=\"\">Theatre Royal Stratford East</a>, Waiting for Godot at the Young Vic and <a href=\"https://www.ebid.net/uk/for-sale/pirandello-s-henry-iv-richard-harris-1990-wyndham-s-theatre-programme-150332149.htm\" title=\"\">Pirandello\u2019s Henry IV at the Wyndham</a>.</p> <p>We met through friends and married in 1986.

When massive objects merge, this curvature can be altered, sending ripples out across the universe. These are known as gravitational waves.By the time these disturbances reach us, they are almost imperceptible. It was only a century after Einstein's prediction that scientists developed a detector sensitive enough - the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory or Ligo - and were able to confirm the existence of gravitational waves.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The direct detection of gravitational waves also opens a new vista on the \u201cdark\u201d side of the cosmos, to times and places from which no optical light escapes. This includes just fractions of a second after the Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago, when scientists believe gravitational waves left a permanent imprint on the cosmos that may still be perceptible today.</p> \n<p>Speaking at a press conference after the announcement, Weiss, an emeritus professor of physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the 2015 detection was the culmination of decades of work, involving more than 1,000 scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s as long as 40 years of people thinking about this, trying to make a detections, sometimes failing \u2026 and then slowly but surely getting the technology together to be able do it,\u201d he said, adding that receiving the phone call from the Nobel committee had been \u201creally wonderful\u201d.</p> \n<p>The notion that spacetime is malleable was first predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. But Einstein himself was unsure whether this was merely a mathematical illusion, and concluded that, in any case, the signal would be so tiny that it would \u201cnever play a role in science\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was a significant career gamble then, when in the mid-1970s Weiss and Thorne, who is now the Feynman professor of theoretical physics at California Institute of Technology, began on the decades-long quest to detect gravitational waves, which they believed could revolutionise our understanding of the universe.</p> \n<p>Weiss designed a detector, called a laser-based inferometer, that he believed would be capable of measuring a signal so tiny that it could easily be masked by the background murmur of the ocean waves. Thorne, a theorist, began making crucial predictions of what the signal of a gravitational wave emanating from two black holes colliding would actually look like.</p> \n<p>Independently, Ronald Drever, a Scottish physicist, also began building prototype detectors in Glasgow and after moving to Caltech, he, Weiss and Thorne formed a trio that laid the groundwork for Ligo. Drever died in March after suffering from dementia, and while the Nobel prize is not normally awarded posthumously, he is widely recognised as having made a decisive contribution.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/will-nobel-prize-overlook-master-builder-gravitational-wave-detectors\">Barry Barish</a>, a former particle physicist at California Institute of Technology (now emeritus professor) came to the project at a much later stage, but is often credited for making Ligo happen. When he took over as its second director in 1994, the project was at risk of being cancelled.

At the start of the 20 millisecond \u201cchirp\u201d in the signal, the two objects were found to be circling each other 30 times a second. By the end, the rate had accelerated to 250 times a second before meeting in a violent collision.<br></p> \n<p>Since then, three further black hole collisions have been made and rumours are afoot that the consortium may have also observed the collision of a pair of neutron stars. In the future, scientists hope to supernovae, pulsars and the insides of stars as they collapse into black holes. A network of gravitational-wave observatories could even allow us to gaze back to almost the beginning of time itself.</p> \n<p>Thorne said: \u201cThe prize rightfully belongs to the hundreds of Ligo scientists and engineers who built and perfected our complex gravitational-wave interferometers, and the hundreds of \u2026 scientists who found the gravitational-wave signals in Ligo\u2019s noisy data and extracted the waves\u2019 information.\u201d</p> \n<p>Barish said he was humbled and honoured to receive the award. \u201cThe detection of gravitational waves is truly a triumph of modern large-scale experimental physics,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Sheila Rowan, director of the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow, said: \u201cWe are really on the threshold of a whole new way to study our universe and that\u2019s hugely exciting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Paul Hardaker, chief executive officer of the Institute of Physics, said: \u201cFor as long as we have had astronomy we have used light in some form or another to understand how our universe works. This significant result marked the beginning of another way of viewing the universe, using gravity, which is what makes it such a major step forward, and so deserving of a Nobel prize.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sir Martin Rees, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Cambridge, and the Astronomer Royal, said this year\u2019s laureates are \u201coutstanding individuals and whose contributions were distinctive and complementary\u201d. However, he said the decision to award individuals rather than collaborations was increasingly problematic, and did not reflect the nature of modern science.<br></p> \n<p>Last year\u2019s prize went to three British physicists for their work on exotic states of matter that may pave the way for quantum computers and other revolutionary technologies.</p> \n<p>On Monday, three American scientists shared the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/02/nobel-prize-for-medicine-awarded-for-insights-into-internal-biological-clock\">2017 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine</a> for their painstaking work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/02/nobel-prizes-2017-everything-you-need-to-know-about-circadian-rhythms\">circadian rhythms</a>.

The two combined to form a single black hole with a mass slightly less than 49 times that of the sun and the leftover energy spilled out as deformations that spread outwards across spacetime like ripples across a pond.</p> <p>Ligo scientists made the first historic observation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">gravitational waves</a> in September 2015, using a pair of 4km-long perpendicular pipes, one in Hanford, Washington state, the other in Livingston, Louisiana.

We\u2019re really interested in doing a new type of astronomy.\u201d</p> <p>The detectors are sensitive enough to pick up distortions as tiny as one thousandth of the diameter of a proton in laser beams sent down Ligo\u2019s tubes, and can even crudely recreate the dynamics of the collisions.</p> <p>The astronomers believe their latest finding \u201cprovides clues about the directions in which the black holes are spinning\u201d. As pairs of black holes spiral inwards, heading towards a collision, they also spin on their own axes. The latest observations hint that these spins are misaligned. This could indicate that the pair of black holes formed not from a binary star system, but from two independent black holes that randomly came together in a dense primordial star cluster.</p> <h2>Black holes and dark matter</h2> <p>Intriguingly, the observations are consistent with one of the more exotic explanations for the nature of dark matter \u2013 that dark matter haloes observed around galaxies are made up of a smattering of small black holes.</p> <p>The theory would require these black holes to have been formed in the early universe, from patches of material\u2013 rather than stars \u2013 collapsing inwards. The latest observations reveal the existence of black holes in a \u201cmass window\u201d that would be consistent with this theory. However, the theory is still viewed as \u201ca little exotic\u201d, according to Berry.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4gjbp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2454865\"            data-video-name=\"Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56bcb63fe4b0d007e4723bec\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\">Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The study once again puts Albert Einstein\u2019s theories to the test.

Rooted in a dispute between gangs for control of drug trafficking, it has disrupted the daily life of the community in Rio de Janeiro since mid-September. With the sound of shots coming from all sides, schools and shops are constantly forced to close. Recently, a stray bullet killed a Spanish tourist. The war is not the only thing being lost.<br /></p> <p> For decades, Brazil has had the same drug policy approach. Police, weapons and numerous arrests. It does not take an expert to conclude the obvious: the strategy has failed. Drug trafficking and consumption have only increased. Einstein is credited with a saying \u2013 though apparently it is not his \u2013 that applies well to the case: insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c16a612207e8e48559fdceae3d4ab319d38f94b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c16a612207e8e48559fdceae3d4ab319d38f94b5/756_0_3038_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cThe insanity of Brazil\u2019s drug policy is striking\u2019: Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apu Gomes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In a case still before the Brazilian supreme court, I voted for decriminalising the possession of marijuana for private consumption. The case has been suspended and no date has been set for its resumption. I also proposed to open a broad debate on the legalisation of marijuana, to begin with \u2013 and then, if successful, cocaine. The subject is extremely delicate, and the outcome hinges on a decision from the legislature. </p> <p>Drugs are an issue that has a profound impact on the criminal justice system, and it is legitimate for the supreme court to participate in the public debate. So here are the reasons for my views.</p> <p>First, drugs are bad and it is therefore the role of the state and society to discourage consumption, treat dependents and repress trafficking. The rationale behind legalisation is rooted in the belief that it will help in achieving these goals. </p> <p>Second, the war on drugs has failed. Since the 1970s, under the influence and leadership of the US, the world has tackled this problem with the use of police forces, armies, and armaments. The tragic reality is that 40 years, billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of prisoners and thousands of deaths later, things are worse. At least in countries like Brazil. </p> <p>Third, as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLsCC0LZxkY\">American economist Milton Friedman argued</a>, the only result of criminalisation is ensuring the trafficker\u2019s monopoly.</p> <p> With these points in mind, what would legalisation achieve? </p> <p>In most countries in North America and Europe, the greatest concern of the authorities is users and the impact drugs have on their lives and on society. These are all important considerations. In Brazil, however, the principal focus must be ending the dominance drug dealers exercise over poor communities. Gangs have become the main political and economic power in thousands of modest neighbourhoods in Brazil. This scenario prevents a family of honest and hard-working people from educating their children away from the influence of criminal factions, who intimidate, co-opt and exercise an unfair advantage over any lawful activity. Crucially, this power of trafficking comes from illegality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/19/rio-voices-view-from-the-favelas-we-hit-rock-bottom-financially-and-socially\">View from the Rio favelas: 'We hit rock bottom, financially and socially' | Michel Silva</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Another benefit of legalisation would be to prevent the mass incarceration of impoverished young people with no criminal record who are arrested for trafficking because they are caught in possession of negligible amounts of marijuana. A third of detainees in Brazil are imprisoned for drug trafficking. Once arrested, young prisoners will have to join one of the factions that control the penitentiaries \u2013 and on that day, they become dangerous. </p> <p>Moreover, each place in prison costs 40,000 reais (\u00a39,174) to create and 2,000 reais a month to maintain. Worse still, within a day of one man being arrested, another is recruited from the reserve army that exists in poor communities.</p> <p> The insanity of this policy is striking: it destroys lives, generates worse outcomes for society, is expensive, and has no impact on drug trafficking. Only superstition, prejudice or ignorance could make someone think this is effective. </p> <p> For these reasons, I believe we should consider alternative means of combating drugs, not least better planning, expert engagement and greater attention to the experiences of other countries. We should consider the possibility of dealing with marijuana as we deal with cigarettes: a licit product, regulated, sold in certain places, taxed, and subject to age and advertisement restrictions, warning notices and campaigns discouraging consumption. In the past two decades, cigarette consumption in Brazil has more than halved; fighting in the light of day, with ideas and information, has brought better results.</p> <p> We cannot be certain that a progressive and cautious policy of decriminalisation and legalisation will be successful. What we can affirm is that the existing policy of criminalisation has failed. We must take chances; otherwise, we risk simply accepting a terrible situation. As the Brazilian navigator Amyr Klink said: \u201cThe worst shipwreck is not setting off at all.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

You can choose from Einstein, Tesla, Pythagoras, Hawking, Turing, Darwin, Newton and Curie (it would have been nice to see more female scientists on the roster), and each comes with their own set of science-based power-ups. Stephen Hawking can create black holes to inflict damage on your opponent, while Curie harnesses the power of radium-coated hands to unleash a fireball reminiscent of Ryu\u2019s Hadouken.</p> <p>Aside from signature moves, you have basic weak and strong attacks \u2013 Newton is pretty brutal in this department, brandishing a telescope to lamp opponents over the head with. If you don\u2019t have time to play, Diego Sanches, the animator for the game, has a gallery of all of the moves as GIFs <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/34335649/science-combat\">here</a>.</p> <p>Gameplay is pretty basic, but there are some nice little surprises in the game \u2013 not least the end boss in tournament mode. According to the website, the game is also going to be ported to mobile platforms \u2013 so there\u2019s still an opportunity for the roster to be rounded out a little more. But all in all, it\u2019s well worth a few minutes of your time, especially if you\u2019ve ever wondered who would win in a fight between Einstein and Darwin. For what it\u2019s worth, my money\u2019s on Chuck.</p>",

The only downside is that scientists have yet to find any experimental proof that it is right \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/oct/08/research.highereducation\">critics question</a> whether its predictions are even testable. </p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/06/048/\">a new paper</a> has claimed that gravitational wave measurements could hold the key to whether string theory is destined to fulfil its lofty goals or be consigned to the dustbin of discarded ideas. The study suggests that the first observable evidence for the existence of extra dimensions, one of string theory\u2019s predictions, could be hidden within the ripples of gravitational waves.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be amazing because general relativity and Einstein do not predict this at all,\u201d said David Andriot, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam and co-author of the study.</p> <p>The crux of string theory \u2013 although there are many competing versions \u2013 is that all particles can be viewed as one-dimensional strings on which the fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism and so on) act as different modes of vibration. For reasons better explained in maths than words, the framework also requires there to be at least six extra spatial dimensions, in addition to time and the three spatial ones of everyday life. </p> <p>Scientists, notably those working at the Large Hadron Collider, have looked for energy vanishing into these hypothetical extra dimensions, but so far efforts have been inconclusive. One possibility is that the dimensions are coiled up so tightly that they are imperceptible; another is that they are not there at all.</p> <p>Andriot is hopeful that the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) experiment could start to answer this question. </p> <p>In 2015, Ligo made the historic first observation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">gravitational waves</a>, the compression and stretching of space that Einstein predicted would occur as a mass moves through the fabric of the universe. In this case, Ligo\u2019s detectors were picking up the ripples sent out across space-time following the violent collision of a pair of black holes more than a billion years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f01871f96627a4114c8bfae39242cce987f1cc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f01871f96627a4114c8bfae39242cce987f1cc5/97_168_1906_1143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) technician inspects the twin detectors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) technician inspects the device\u2019s twin detectors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LIGO Laboratory/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>String theory predicts that, during such cataclysmic events, ripples should also be travelling through the extra spatial dimensions and that there should be subtle interactions between the standard waves and those hidden from view.</p> <p>\u201cOur study concludes that if there are extra dimensions it would lead to another mode of shrinking and stretching,\u201d said Andriot.</p> <p>The latest paper, published in the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/06/048/meta\">Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics</a>, concludes this would produce a \u201cbreathing\u201d effect, superimposed on the main gravitational wave. The pattern might be measurable once a third detector, called Virgo, joins the twin Ligo detectors in gathering data late next year or early in 2019, although the team have not yet worked out whether the effect would be big enough to spot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">Gravitational waves: breakthrough discovery after a century of expectation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we have extra dimensions we can get this effect, but there are other things that could cause it. It\u2019s not a smoking gun for extra dimensions,\u201d said Andriot.</p> <p>Christopher Berry, a scientist working on Ligo at the University of Birmingham, said it is a priority to look for the kinds of subtle modifications to gravitational waves described in the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the classic tests that we would like to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Such observations would be hugely significant because they are not predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, meaning that our understanding of how gravity behaves would need to be revised. One option is string theory, but there are other competing theories. The absence of the \u201cbreathing\u201d effect would help rule out some of these theories, or narrow the window in which they could occur.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect that any deviations from general relativity would happen in the most extreme conditions \u2013 that\u2019s where you\u2019d expect the theory would break,\u201d said Berry. \u201cThe best place for testing that is the collision of black holes.\u201d</p> <p>The paper also predicts that gravitational waves should ripple through each extra dimension at a characteristic frequency \u2013 analogous to the way organ pipes of different lengths produce notes of different pitch. Working on the assumption that the extra dimensions are very small, a series of higher-frequency gravitational waves would be predicted. These would be at a frequency more than a billion times higher than the limit of what Ligo could detect, but which might be observable one day by a future detector.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was seen, we could talk of a smoking gun,\u201d said Andriot. </p> <p>Others remain unconvinced that such observations would provide the sought-after experimental proof. Peter Woit, a theoretical physicist at Columbia University, New York, and longstanding critic of string theory, said: \u201cThe problem is that string theory says nothing at all about the sizes of these extra dimensions, they could be anything from infinitely large to infinitely small, so there\u2019s no real prediction. If we ever do see extra dimensions, there\u2019s no particular reason to believe these have anything to do with string theory.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 July 2017. An earlier version said David Andriot was the lead author of the study. This has been changed to say Andriot is a co-author.<br /></p>",

In March 2016, a 26-year-old British man, Ben Innes, a passenger on an EgyptAir flight, managed to persuade the plane\u2019s hijacker, Seif Eldin Mustafa, to pose with him for a selfie. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/30/briton-ben-innes-posed-selfie-egyptair-hijacker-praised-by-relatives\" title=\"\">In the photo</a>, Mustafa is wearing what appears to be an explosives vest (though it was later found to be fake).</p> <p>If the internet has radically altered the way we think, the smartphone is simultaneously altering the way we look \u2013 and are looked at \u2013 in ways that would have seemed unimaginable a few decades ago. As both these examples illustrate, our behaviour has changed accordingly: we seem to have become less self-conscious and self-aware. Thus, posing for selfies, snapping total strangers and filming almost everything we do, from eating lunch to attending a concert, has become so commonplace as to be rarely commented on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One section contrasts the ways in which animals and humans became exotic spectacles for western audiences in the 1800s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Written by film-maker, critic and one-time television presenter Mark Cousins, <em>The Story of Looking</em> is certainly timely. It roams freely across history, art, film, photography, science and technology. His journey into looking begins with him imagining\u00a0how an early Homo sapiens\u2019 baby might have seen the world \u2013 as a \u201csoft-edged\u201d and \u201cimmaterial\u201d shadowland \u2013 and ends, more than 400 pages later, with a meditation on G\u00e9ricault\u2019s still shocking painting, <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/119264\" title=\"\"><em>Head of a Guillotined Man</em></a>. In between those two well-chosen reference points \u2013 the birth of human looking and the unflinching gaze of an artist \u2013 Cousins covers so much disparate ground that it is sometimes hard to see the wood for the trees.</p> <p>He is illuminating on the various ways artists and film-makers look at the world, but his style, a kind of thematic free association, made me long for the conciseness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/06/john-berger-remembered-by-geoff-dyer-olivia-laing-and-ali-smith\" title=\"\">John Berger</a> in his game-changing book, <em>Ways of Seeing</em>. A section entitled Atomic Looking shifts in the space of 10 pages from Luis Bu\u00f1uel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/22/satyajit-ray-artifice-honesty-film\" title=\"\">Satyajit Ray</a>, by way of Albert Einstein, Piero della Francesca, John Sayles, Max Planck and Van Gogh. The effect is dazzling, but disorienting, not least because the images referred to, whether still or moving, often require a degree of patience, attentiveness and slow looking from the viewer. Unlike Berger, Cousins does not have an ideological axe to grind so his book often reads like a primer for art and media studies students.</p> <p>For all that, there is much that is surprising here, not least in Cousins\u2019s remarkable ability to make you look again at the act of looking, often through arresting juxtapositions. A section entitled Zoos and Morgues contrasts the ways in which animals and humans became exotic spectacles for western audiences in the early 1800s. In one photograph, a row of well-dressed men\u00a0in shiny shoes stare at a reconstruction of a Sudanese village featuring actual Nubian men, women and children. \u201cDid they make eye contact, even for a moment?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd if so, what did each side think? Did the polished shoe people feel ashamed? Probably not, because the ideas of the time led them to believe that others should be available for their inspection.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/20/mark-cousins-children-film-cannes\">Mark Cousins: the kids stay in the picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unsurprisingly, Cousins is incisive about cinematic ways of looking, beginning with the notorious moment in Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s 1929 film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1146569,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>Un Chien Andalou</em></a>, in which a razor blade apparently slices a young woman\u2019s eyeball. The scene, he writes, \u201ccan be taken as a metaphor for the violent increase in looking and imaging\u201d in the 20th century. It could also be read as a metaphor for the ways in which deep looking has been assailed by the unprecedented profligacy of 21st-century image culture. We are besieged by photographs that often drift unmoored from their contexts and\u00a0no amount of looking can account for their banality. One could go as far as\u00a0to say that we are being blinded by the sheer ubiquity of often banal images in the age of Facebook and the selfie. Cousins disagrees, arguing that \u201cit is too easy to overlook how liberating and affirming the effects of the\u00a0former can be\u201d, and \u201cselfies are mainly a sign of how fascinated we are with seeing ourselves in groups and in the world\u201d. No mention of the downside: our increasingly narcissistic culture or the blaming and bullying that also infects social media.</p> <p>For students of art and film, <em>The Story of Looking</em> may well prove indispensable as a reference book, but it seems a rather well-mannered and all too forgiving response to the turbulent times we live in.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Story of Looking </em>by Mark Cousins is published by Canongate (\u00a325).

          "body": "<p>My father, Sydney Cohen, a scientist with a deep love of nature, who has died aged 95, developed from his South African education and wide travels in Africa a determination to vanquish malaria, the continent\u2019s scourge.</p> <p>His pursuit of a vaccine led, in 1961, to a landmark paper in Nature, co-written with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Ian McGregor</a>, that found that immunoglobulin from immune Gambian adults had an anti-parasitic effect when administered to infected children. While variation in parasites has precluded to this day an effective vaccine against all strains of malaria, Sydney was one of the first to show that successful vaccination was possible, using forms of the parasite that live in the blood.</p> <p>In recognition of his work, Sydney was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and was appointed CBE in 1978. He was a member of the Medical Research Council and chairman of its Tropical Medicine Research Board (1974-76).</p> <p>He was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the last of four children of Pauline (nee Soloveychik) and Morris Cohen, Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. His grandfather, Shmuel, had opened a wholesale grocery in downtown Johannesburg. Sydney completed a medical degree at the University of the Witwatersrand, before sailing to Britain on SS Nestor, arriving 10 days after the end of the second world war in Europe. At the Royal Berkshire hospital, in Reading, he treated the war injured \u2013 and was astounded to see a white woman on her hands and knees cleaning the floor.</p> <p>The ensuing decade was spent moving back and forth between Britain and South Africa, where Sydney\u2019s last post was as dean of the one remaining residence for black students at Wits. He repeatedly had to extricate his talented black students from unjustified arrest by the police force. By the time the student house was finally shut down in 1963 under the tightening grip of apartheid, Sydney had emigrated, disgusted by the waste of South Africa\u2019s human potential.</p> <p>In London, Sydney worked at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, north London, and then at St Mary\u2019s hospital, Paddington, where his talents as an immunologist were recognised by Rodney Porter, who would win the Nobel prize for medicine in 1972 for determining the chemical structure of an antibody. From 1965 until his retirement in 1986, he was professor of chemical pathology at Guy\u2019s hospital, and he was chair from 1976 to 1981 of the World Health Organisation\u2019s steering committee on the immunology of malaria.</p> <p>Sydney enjoyed painting, gardening, carpentry and golf. He had a marvellously deadpan sense of humour. When a South African relative suggested he change his name, because Cohen was too conspicuously Jewish to make it in Britain, he said that was a wonderful idea \u2013 and suggested Einstein, instead.</p> <p>In 1950 he married June Adler, a magistrate whom he met at a tennis party at her grandfather\u2019s house in Johannesburg. June died in 1999. That year he married Deirdre Boyd, who had assisted him at Guy\u2019s, and<strong> </strong>later<strong> </strong>they moved to St Andrews, on Scotland\u2019s east coast, where he was a member of the Royal and Ancient golf club.</p> <p>Deirdre survives him, as do his children from his first marriage, me and my sister, Jenny, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</p>",

The rage, oh the rage! The partner whose snoring is a nightly middle-finger to your restless mind. The colleague who complains, \u201cI\u2019m so tired, I only got six hours\u2019 sleep last night.\u201d Six hours! That\u2019s a\u00a0holiday for an insomniac.

Ask \u201cHow could you do this?\u201d \u201cHave you done anything similar before?\u201d \u201cWhat did you do then?\u201d This helps them develop their own learning ideas and makes them much less likely to say they can\u2019t do things.<br />\u2022 Build big picture thinking. Ask \u201cWhat would happen if \u2026 it never got dark/the rivers ran dry/ everyone ignored the law?\u201d A key characteristic of students labelled as gifted is their ability to see how learning connects to the wider world. <br />\u2022 Build imagination. Ask \u201cHow would you weigh a giraffe/rhinoceros/bridge/house/star?\u201d Creativity builds learning capability and is vital for high performance.<br />\u2022 Develop critical or logical thinking. Ask \u2018Why do you think \u2026 bread goes mouldy if you don\u2019t freeze it/babies cry/ leaves fall when autumn comes?\u201d The ability to deduct, hypothesise, reason and seek evidence is probably the characteristic most \u00adassociated with academic success.<br />\u2022 Help them monitor their own \u00adprogress. Ask: \u201cWhat do you need to be able to do this? How can you check you\u2019re on track? How can you tell whether you are doing it right?\u201d This one is the key to maximising thinking skills.</p> <p><strong>Behave right </strong><br />\u2022 Intellectual confidence. This is a \u201ccan do\u201d approach to learning, even when it\u2019s hard. If a child says they are no good at something, say: \u201cI know you can. I know it\u2019s hard to do now but I know you can learn how to do this in time if you work at it.\u201d<br />\u2022 Open mindedness. Being open to new ideas is the hallmark of an advanced learner. Start with being open minded yourself so you model what it\u2019s like to be receptive to ideas that differ from your own. <br />\u2022 Curiosity. Children ask lots of questions if you answer them, though the number falls dramatically once they get to school and only the class teacher is there to answer. The desire to know more \u2013 curiosity \u2013 is at the heart of all learning. High performance is fuelled by it. The more curious children are, the more whys and hows they ask, the better they do at school and in life.<br />\u2022 Practice. It\u2019s the only way to get good at something. Make sure it is regular, deliberate and planned, working towards achievable incremental goals, and that you practise what you can\u2019t do well.<br />\u2022 Perseverance. To keep going when it\u2019s tough is the most important behaviour in high performance. Model it yourself. With younger children you can talk about what would happen if no one persevered \u2013 the farmer who didn\u2019t bother to harvest his crops, the builder to finish the house, the \u00adsurgeon to complete the operation. With older ones, encourage a sense of pride in what they do so that they are motivated to persevere.</p> <p><em>Great Minds and How to Grow Them, by Wendy Berliner &amp; Deborah Eyre.

Scientists are the new rock stars. Tonight Einstein gets the full soft-focus Crown-style treatment as National Geographic launches a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/genius-geoffrey-rush-einstein-nat-geo-a7690731.html\">10-part series</a> about the man described by the actor Geoffrey Rush, who portrays him in Genius, as a \u201cstud-muffin theoretical physicist\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2017/apr/23/why-i-marched-for-science\">Why I marched for science</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scientist as hero is familiar enough. What\u2019s less familiar is scientists demonstrating, thousands of them around the world, with placards and banners declaring \u201cScience improves decisions\u201d and other inflammatory assertions, such as \u201cScience belongs to no country because knowledge belongs to humanity\u201d. \u201cEvidence not arrogance,\u201d they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/22/evidence-not-arrogance-uk-supporters-join-global-march-for-science\">demanded</a>.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t have to be anti-science to see that there is an inevitability about its difficult relationship with politics. It is the point where knowledge and belief collide, which is why it is now the crucible of the culture wars.</p> <p>Scientists can\u2019t but be the villains of the Brexit narrative. They are highly educated in the ultimate transferrable skills. They are the quintessential citizens of the world, people who keep their passports in their back pockets, and often work not just in towns where they were not born but in countries their parents never imagined visiting. They might dream of a Nobel prize, but they may also have an eye on a job in Silicon Valley. Intellectual property is the new alchemy.</p> <p>More challenging than their lifestyles, however, is their insistence on the sanctity of evidence and the importance of making decisions based on established fact. Expert-deniers trade on the natural resistance to uncomfortable truth by asserting that the truth is a negotiable quality. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2099977-what-donald-trump-has-said-about-science-and-why-hes-wrong/\">thinks</a> windfarms are bad for your health, and low-energy lightbulbs give you cancer. He has linked childhood immunisation with autism. Although he tweeted yesterday that \u201crigorous science is critical to my administration\u201d, he has yet to appoint a scientific policy adviser.</p> <p>In one way, this is an argument that was already well rehearsed when Pope Paul V took on Galileo 400 years ago. Science and belief have always rubbed up against each other. They find compromise positions. Popes die. In the end, science emerges victorious.</p> <p>Yet there are differences. Trump is not arguing from some alternative, God-centred perspective. He is not defending a belief system subscribed to by most of the known world. He just doesn\u2019t like facts that contradict what he wants to say. The expert-deniers rest their case on experts sometimes being wrong. They refuse to recognise that to know something properly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\">it must be capable of being proved wrong</a>. If it is, that in fact constitutes the advancement of knowledge.</p> <p>There is another reason science is at the heart of this argument. Scientists are all very well when they are discovering penicillin and working out how to transfer great quantities of data instantaneously. Science is good when it makes life longer, easier, richer and more comfortable and convenient. It is also wonderful when it is makes discoveries concerning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/sweet-naked-mole-rats-can-survive-without-oxygen-using-plant-sugar-tactic-fructose\">metabolism of naked mole rats</a>, or <a href=\"http://newatlas.com/negative-mass-fluid/49040/\">negative-mass fluids</a> \u2013 mind-boggling discoveries that are basically irrelevant to most people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>It is a harder sell when it points to unacceptable realities. It\u2019s disagreeable to stop smoking or to drink less alcohol or to avoid sugary drinks. The people who make cigarettes, booze and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/22/bathtub-of-sugary-drinks-a-year-cancer-warning-over-teenage-intake\">fizzy drinks</a> are often unscrupulous in defence of their products and their profits. Accepting that our way of life threatens the sustainability of the planet was never going to be easy. Donald Trump is not a new version of a 17th-century pope, but there are millions of US voters who believe he can preserve their world: a world that depends on coal and cars.</p> <p>There was plenty to admire about the scientists\u2019 protest. But it\u2019s increasingly clear that their greatest skill \u2013 unearthing the truth \u2013 is not enough to win a culture war.</p>",

Hawking said: \u201cEach generation stands on the shoulders of those who have gone before them, just as I did as a young PhD student in Cambridge, inspired by the work of Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein.

He remains a commanding figure decades after a form of motor neurone disease \u2013 diagnosed soon after his 21st birthday \u2013 left him confined to a wheelchair and dependent on a computerised voice system for speech.</p> <p>His 1988 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/07/100-best-nonfiction-books-6-brief-history-of-time-stephen-hawking\">A Brief History of Time</a> became one of the most successful popular science books ever published, with more than 10m copies sold worldwide in more than 40 languages.</p> <p>At Oxford he studied physics though his father wanted him to take medicine, because his own original choice of mathematics wasn\u2019t available. According to <a href=\"http://www.hawking.org.uk/about-stephen.html\">his website</a>, \u201cafter three years and not very much work\u201d he was awarded a first-class honours degree \u2013 he now holds 12 honorary degrees \u2013 and then moved to Cambridge to undertake research in cosmology. From 1979 to 2009 he was the Lucasian professor of mathematics at the university \u2013 a post once held by Isaac Newton \u2013 and he retains an office in the department.</p> <p>The university hopes that Hawking\u2019s thesis may encourage other scholars to make their work freely available online. From this October all PhD graduates will be required to deposit a digital copy of their theses, and will be urged to make them open access. Cambridge will also be trying to persuade all its former academics, who include 98 Nobel prize winners, to follow Hawking\u2019s example.</p> <p>The university library has 8m books and periodicals, and a million maps, on 125 miles of shelving expanding by two miles every year.</p> <p>The treasures in the Apollo archive, which together have been downloaded a million times from all over the world in 2017, include 15,000 research articles, 10,000 images and 2,400 theses. However, the university says it is often a struggle to give free access to historic theses.</p> <p>Arthur Smith, deputy head of scholarly communication, said more open-access research could lead to major breakthroughs. He said: \u201cBy eliminating the barriers between people and knowledge we can realise new breakthroughs in all areas of science, medicine and technology. </p> <p>\u201cIt is especially important for disseminating the knowledge acquired during doctoral research studies. PhD theses contain a vast trove of untapped and unique information just waiting to be used, but which is often locked away from view and scrutiny.\u201d</p> <p>Hawking, whose original medical diagnosis more than half a century ago gave him two years to live, continues to work and and lecture internationally. Richard Branson has offered him a free place on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/10/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-interview\">Virgin Galactic spacecraft</a>, and his website says \u201che still hopes to make it into space one day\u201d.</p>",

Cats, cows, pigs and mice all appear the same \u2013 round heads and bodies drawn with four stick legs poking out. And it isn\u2019t just this particular class. With few exceptions, the pattern is repeated in every year group that I teach.</p> <p>According to the primary national curriculum, we should be teaching children to become \u201cproficient in drawing\u201d.

Music is sidelined too, as are languages. Children are removed from French lessons for extra reading and writing interventions; school productions are shelved due to lack of practice time; opportunities for drama are reduced to the odd English lesson. </p> <p>I get why it\u2019s happening. Teachers are under pressure to improve outcomes for reading, writing and maths, particularly in year groups where Sats are the only tool for assessing children. I\u2019ve been in that position myself, forced to make changes to timetables I\u2019d rather not. Before I became a primary modern languages teacher I taught year 6. Every January I would sit down with my colleagues and take a red pen to the timetable I\u2019d carefully crafted in September, replacing music with extra comprehension or swapping French for additional spelling sessions. </p> <p>In a recent NEU (then the NUT) survey, 97% of the union\u2019s teachers agreed that Sats preparation did not support <a href=\"https://www.teachers.org.uk/education-policies/primary/crisis-in-primary-assessment\">children\u2019s access to a broad and balanced curriculum</a>, saying the time taken to prepare children for assessment in maths and English has squeezed out other subjects and activities. The problem doesn\u2019t stop when our children leave primary. The proportion of 15- and 16-year-olds taking subjects like music and drama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/21/proportion-of-students-taking-arts-subjects-falls-to-lowest-level-in-decade\">fallen to its lowest level in 10 years</a>. The study of modern foreign languages at GCSE is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/fall-in-number-of-students-taking-modern-foreign-languages-brexit-british-council-prompts-concerns-a7877491.html\">also in decline</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worry about the message we\u2019re sending our children when we push arts and languages into the background</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I feel strongly that our schools are missing a trick. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/03/school-results-music-bradford\">Feversham Primary in Bradford recently made headlines</a> for its focus on teaching the arts, particularly music, which has led to improved pupil outcomes. The fact that the school\u2019s approach has made the national newspapers is enough to tell us it\u2019s unusual. The problem is that adopting a revolutionary approach such as this is a risk that, facing budget cuts and Ofsted scrutiny, most headteachers are not willing to take.</p> <p>Improving outcomes aside, I worry about the message we\u2019re sending our children when we push arts and languages into the background. I worry we\u2019re creating a gulf between children whose parents can afford to take them to private music lessons, language clubs or the theatre, and those whose access comes mainly through the school curriculum. </p> <p>But more than all this, I\u2019m reminded of an Einstein quote \u2013 the one that says that if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will spend its life thinking it is stupid. There are children who struggle to read but come to life on the stage. There are those who just can\u2019t concentrate in other lessons but will sit and paint for an hour without leaving their seat. If our schools are only interested in children\u2019s progress and attainment in a limited range of subjects, how can we ever hope to build on the potential of those whose strengths lie elsewhere?</p> <p>The trouble is that creativity, increased confidence or a love of the arts aren\u2019t easily measured through standardised tests, data analysis or league tables. Maybe that\u2019s why, ultimately, certain subjects are sidelined. Perhaps I\u2019m idealistic, but this is an issue that bothers me. It should bother my school leadership and government too. </p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuardianTeacherNetwork/\">Facebook</a>, and join the <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/agree/GTNF?returnUrl=https://teachers.theguardian.com/Registration.aspx\">Guardian Teacher Network</a> the latest articles direct to your inbox</strong><br /></p> <p><strong>Looking for a teaching job?

          "body": "<p>The American composer <a href=\"http://philipglass.com/\">Philip Glass</a>, 80 this month, has been one of the dominant, boundary-crossing influences of the past half century. He first won a worldwide following in the 1970s with <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em>, <em>Einstein on the Beach </em>and <em>Satyagraha</em>, and has collaborated with Allen Ginsberg, Robert Wilson, Doris Lessing, Martin Scorsese, Ravi Shankar, David Bowie, Paul Simon and many more. Glass\u2019s birthday will be marked with a production by Scottish Opera of his opera <a href=\"https://www.scottishopera.org.uk/our-operas/16-17/the-trial\"><em>The Trial</em></a><em> </em>and a <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/music/series.asp?ID=1697\">Philip Glass at 80</a> weekend at the Barbican.</p> <p><strong>It seems that no one \u2013 not you, or Steve Reich, or John Adams \u2013 likes being called a minimalist. What do we call you if not that?</strong><br />Let\u2019s talk about this. The problem is no one is doing minimalism now. It\u2019s music we wrote in the 1970s. It\u2019s over 30 years out of date. It\u2019s a crazy idea to use a description made up by journalists and editors to cover all kinds of music. It\u2019s more confusing than descriptive. What do I really do? Listen to me. I\u2019ve written 26 operas, 20 ballets, I don\u2019t know how many film scores. I write theatre music. I write concert and symphonies too. I\u2019m working on a new film score right now. Then I\u2019ll start a new stage piece. My problem is people don\u2019t believe I write symphonies. But I\u2019m <a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2017/1/31/0730/PM/Bruckner-Orchestra-Linz/\">premiering Symphony No 11 </a>in a couple of weeks. These are all different forms of music. Maybe I do too many things.</p> <p><strong>But it\u2019s the description that sticks: Philip Glass, the great American minimalist\u2026</strong><br />If people called me an American opera composer it would have the virtue of being what I actually do. This is reality. God forbid we should be accurate. I\u2019m not making this stuff up. Would it be easier to say I\u2019m an Icelandic composer who writes serial music? Would that be helpful? [Silence, then laughter.] I\u2019m a theatre composer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5a40bf39d6a41ac35a1efab698a9077c5805e74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a40bf39d6a41ac35a1efab698a9077c5805e74/452_0_1383_1569/881.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Glass in Linz, Austria earlier this month for rehearsals of his Symphony No 11.\" width=\"881\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Glass in Linz, Austria earlier this month for rehearsals of his Symphony No 11.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Werner Kerschbaummayr/ AFP/ Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of people want to hear my music of the 1970s and 1980s. And do you know what I do? I play it. I talk to Paul Simon or anyone like that and it\u2019s the same. I say, \u201cwhat do you play live, Paul?\u201d and he says \u201cI play my new songs and I play my hits\u201d. And it\u2019s true. If you go to hear Paul Simon, you want to hear Bridge Over Troubled Water. The new work, by the way, is beautiful, but it\u2019s not why you buy the ticket. You want to hear the old ones. It\u2019s the same for me when I play with my ensemble [the Philip Glass Ensemble]. We\u2019ve been together 40 years. We play the familiar stuff, the highlights.</p> <p><strong>So you\u2019re saying, then, you play\u2026 minimalism</strong>!<br />Well, yes, I admit I am part of the confusion. We\u2019ve reworked a piece from 1971. And, guess what, it\u2019s minimalist! OK OK OK, I\u2019m just as bad as the journalists [more laughs].</p> <p><strong>Growing up in Baltimore, Maryland, you stoked your own musical curiosity by listening to unsold stock in your father\u2019s record store. Was there one really striking discovery?</strong><br />Not one, though I listened to everything \u2013 what we called \u201chillbilly\u201d and Buddy Holly and R&amp;B, as well as Beethoven quartets and things that were quite modern then \u2013 Shostakovich and Bart\u00f3k. But as far as records in the shop were concerned, there was always lots of contemporary music \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.charlesives.org/\">Charles Ives</a>, the great American composer. And the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b086t9mw\">Second Viennese school</a> \u2013 Berg, Webern and, to a lesser extent, Schoenberg. I sent off for his book on basic harmony \u2013 couldn\u2019t find it in the Baltimore bookstores \u2013 and followed it to the letter. It was very traditional!</p> <p>But look, I was devouring a whole range of repertoire at that stage. I was studying music at the Peabody Institute. As a nine- or 10-year-old I was taking part in Bach masses in church performances. At high school they wanted to put on shows, so what did they do? Gilbert and Sullivan! I played flute in the orchestra. I got to understand how theatre works: the musicians in the pit, the timing, the getting singers on and off stage. It\u2019s not a bad way to learn your craft. It gave me a good solid background. When, years later, I came to write opera, I felt comfortable about all that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The people who don\u2019t want your music don\u2019t change their minds. You outlive them, if you\u2019re lucky</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You went off to the University of Chicago, prodigiously early at 15, then to the Juilliard school in New York. But the big break was when you went to Europe. You\u2019ve said you had two angels sitting on your shoulder, your two great teachers, Nadia Boulanger and Ravi Shankar.</strong><br />I\u2019ve always said one taught through fear, one through love. Nadia Boulanger was the great guru in Paris. She was tremendously fierce. She taught me Bach, Beethoven, Mozart \u2013 every tool of western art music \u2013 with an iron rod. It was, in essence, about understanding technique. Then there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ravi-shankar\">Ravi Shankar</a>, a master of Indian concert music. I met him in 1964. So I had two of the greatest exponents of different traditions at the same time. I was about 25 and Ravi was almost 20 years older. I was like a student. I stayed close to him for a long time. We collaborated. I spoke with him just days before he died.</p> <p><strong>Your long immersion in Indian music and philosophy, trying to go beyond cultural tourism, has shaped your outlook, practical and aesthetic\u2026</strong><br />That time in India, which included long stays as well as many shorter ones, visiting frequently from the late 60s until 2001, opened a door to the world of global music. Until then I\u2019d been immersed in European art music. In Kerala I encountered <a href=\"http://www.kathakali.net/\">kathakali</a>, the classical Indian dance theatre which had an influence on my own operas, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/25/how-we-made-satyagraha\"><em>Satyagraha</em></a>. Back then, hearing anything beyond western music wasn\u2019t easy. You couldn\u2019t find records, except a few specialist discs of music collected by anthropologists. If you wanted to hear Balinese music you pretty much had to go to Bali. It\u2019s hard to believe that now.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel you have done what you set out to achieve as a young man? Or does it only make sense now, looking back?</strong><br />I decided early on I wouldn\u2019t be a music teacher or an academic. So as soon as I got back from my studies in Europe in 1967 I formed my ensemble \u2013 seven musicians playing keyboards and a variety of woodwinds, amplified and fed through a mixer\u2026 I felt I had no choice but to be a performer. By then my flute playing had dropped off but I\u2019d sharpened up my keyboard skills. The point of the ensemble was to play the music I\u2019d written. We rehearsed in my house, we played my music! That was the deal. (We did make exceptions and play other stuff, when we rehearsed elsewhere.) And I could sense the response of the audience. Those audiences were tiny at first of course. Sometimes just 20 or so people. And then we got more successful, but it was a long, long time before we made any money. That took another 10 or 15 years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/oct/13/watch-a-clip-from-philip-glass-einstein-on-the-beach\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56ztz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793309\"            data-video-name=\"Watch a clip from Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb71d4e4b06538ee91e188\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010EinsteinOnTheBeach_KP-29666704_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010EinsteinOnTheBeach_KP-29666704.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010EinsteinOnTheBeach_KP-29666704_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/oct/13/watch-a-clip-from-philip-glass-einstein-on-the-beach\">Watch a clip from Philip Glass\u2019s Einstein on the Beach</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong><em>Einstein on the Beach</em> was a massive hit in 1976 yet you still had to drive a taxi and work as a plumber.</strong><br />Yes, after <em>Einstein on the Beach </em>I went back to driving a New York cab. I didn\u2019t mind that. It was interesting work. I didn\u2019t have an agent. I ran all the business side of it and the box office myself. I enjoyed it. I grew up in the music business. I was happy to do it. But it took at lot of time and work. In 1979 when we did our first Carnegie Hall concert we had to pay for it, and sell the tickets! Eventually I formed a publishing company and had people doing it for me.

          "body": "<p>What a miraculous thing art is. Just when you thought you knew what it was, it becomes something else. Perhaps transformation itself is the essence of art \u2013 or perhaps it has no essence at all, but is simply a name we give to whatever heightens life and reveals its beauty. Apologies for these wandering thoughts but the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/susan-philipsz\">Susan Philipsz</a> induces contemplation and reverie, provoking the mind as it enthrals the soul.</p> <p>A Single Voice is her most obviously art-like work of art yet, in that it gives you a film to look at. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/06/turner-prize-winner-susan-philipsz\">Philipsz won the 2010 Turner prize</a> with a room that was empty except for sound, and her work is primarily aural, even if her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/20/susan-philipsz-war-damaged-musical-instruments-review-tate-britain\">recent Tate Britain installation</a> remembering the first world war did feature a collection of battered musical instruments. </p> <p>At Baltic she shows her film of violinist Leila Akhmetova playing, and waiting to play, alone in a studio. A camera mounted on a circular dolly track pans endlessly and restlessly around Akhmetova, closing in as she studies the score on a computer screen, panning away to see her sitting upright playing a prolonged note. It is a compelling, hypnotic study of an orchestral musician taken out of the orchestra, playing alone with strange dignity and wondrous discipline, as the camera silently watches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"659c54b3adb2e3d879c4ed78eb74963457ee057c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/659c54b3adb2e3d879c4ed78eb74963457ee057c/0_70_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen showing violinist Leila Akhmetova in the middle of a hall of speakers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The film Philipsz has made is alluring... yet it is perhaps not the real artwork at all.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image c/o the artist and Baltic Mill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There I go again \u2013 feasting on the visual. A nice motion picture to look at. The film Philipsz has made is alluring, projected on a huge screen in a vast darkened hangar of a space. Yet it is perhaps not the real artwork at all. The heart of her installation is the sound that moves between isolated speakers placed along two sides of the long, post-industrial gallery. As Akhmetova waits to play her part, rich or shrill string notes are heard from different parts of the shadowy cavernous gallery. Then she raises her bow, and as she brings it down you recognise her note streaming from her speaker.</p> <p>As the sound builds up, you are drawn from speaker to speaker, pacing around the installation even as the camera pans around the violinist. The film can be watched from both sides of the screen, making it even more entrancing to move through a space that starts to feel increasingly solid and substantial as it fills, bit by bit, with sound.</p> <p>Science has recently entered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/27/new-gravitational-wave-detection-shows-shape-of-ripples-from-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo\">the age of gravitational waves</a>, as the latest astrophysics proves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Einstein</a>\u2019s century-old theory of space-time. Philipsz too is Einsteinian, it strikes me, as the air vibrates to lonely notes. Sound is a wave in space. Philipsz uses that physical fact to sculpt the very air we breathe. A Single Voice seems to isolate soundwaves and make you feel their reality in space-time.</p> <p>If that seems like science fiction, it is science fiction that has inspired this work. A Single Voice uses the score of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgZmZnxwBoQ\">Aniara</a>, a 1959 modernist composition by Karl-Birger Blomdahl based on an epic poem by <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1974/martinson-article.html\">Harry Martinson</a> about a group of would-be colonists of Mars who get stranded in space. The desolate notes of the violin, keening from one speaker to another, represent the doomed astronauts\u2019 soliloquies as they drift in the vacuum.</p> <p>Yet it is not the narrative of astral travel that makes this work of art so powerful as the tension it creates between sound and vision. Music, it makes you realise, goes straight inside us in a way that images cannot. Looking at Akhmetova on screen, we see her from the outside. The camera almost voyeuristically studies her face and body as she sits attentively and plays her part. Yet while the eye scrutinises, the ear empathises. The music seems a direct unmediated link between souls.</p> <p>In a darkened chamber at the end of the gallery, Philipsz sings alone. She is giving her rendition of every song on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\">David Bowie</a>\u2019s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Not only does this earlier work (recorded in 2001) fit nicely with the sci-fi theme but once again it makes you feel the emotional mystery of music. Here is a fan offering her homage to Bowie, sending a message across the stars to him. It also reaches you, standing in the shadows, absorbed by this strangely intimate work. If Earth was really dying and we had five years left to live, you could do a lot worse than spend some of that time with this visionary artist.</p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/whats-on/exhibitions/susan-philipsz\">Baltic, Gateshead</a>, until 4 March<br /></li> </ul>",

Indeed it is: among the theory\u2019s predictions was that violent events in the universe involving immense masses \u2013 such as the collision and merging of two black holes \u2013 could set the fabric of spacetime ringing, the ripples spreading across the cosmos and stretching or squeezing space as they pass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-answer-biggest-question-albert-einstein\">Gravitational waves may help us answer the biggest question of all | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experiments at the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory facilities in Washington and Louisiana have detected these distortions, and it\u2019s a tremendous, exhilarating moment for science. But it\u2019s been barely noted what a deeply strange, perhaps unprecedented situation this is too. The initial detection event happened last September, in the centenary year of the publication of Einstein\u2019s theory. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/25/video-100-years-of-einsteins-general-relativity\" title=\"\">the theory of general relativity</a> itself is a great rarity in science: for this was not an idea motivated by any need to explain observations, but the result of Albert Einstein simply sitting down and thinking. It isn\u2019t easy to find another example of such a rich, fertile theory conjured, as it were, out of nothing.</p> <p>No one was demanding a new theory of gravity in 1915. We already had one \u2013 devised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/isaac-newton\" title=\"\">Isaac Newton</a> more than two centuries earlier \u2013 and it seemed to work fine. Sure, there were a few little puzzles, such as the <a href=\"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/26408/what-did-general-relativity-clarify-about-mercury\" title=\"\">anomalous motion of the planet Mercury</a>. But these weren\u2019t in any sense the stimulus for the new theory (even though it explained them). No, it arose because Einstein saw the world differently.</p> <p>It began in 1907, when Einstein was 28 and still working as a patent clerk. \u201cI was sitting in the patent office in Bern,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cwhen all of a sudden a thought occurred to me: if a person falls freely, he won\u2019t feel his own weight. I was startled. This simple thought made a deep impression on me. It impelled me toward a theory of gravitation.\u201d This, Einstein attested, was \u201cthe happiest thought of my life\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gjbp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2454865\"            data-video-name=\"Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56bcb63fe4b0d007e4723bec\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\">Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is what set Einstein apart: what seems trivially obvious to most people struck him as profound. Using a complex form of calculus called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar%E2%80%93tensor_theory\" title=\"\">tensor theory</a>, he spent eight years working on a new concept of gravity. The theory of general relativity showed that masses warp space and that in a gravitational field time slows down. It also predicted neutron stars and black holes, although they weren\u2019t accepted for many decades.</p> <p>Many physicists regard general relativity as a theory of exemplary beauty. But it\u2019s difficult too. Its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations\" title=\"\">10 equations</a> can be written down concisely using tensor notation, but in full they\u2019d take up many pages. The difficulty of solving the equations is one reason why, after being first vindicated in 1919 by observations of \u201cbent\u201d starlight during a solar eclipse, the theory languished for decades.</p> <p>Almost all science stems from a need to explain what we see: to solve empirical puzzles. But not general relativity. Are there any other cases where significant new scientific ideas have arisen without any observations demanding explanation? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/may/06/string-theory-and-black-holes\" title=\"\">String theory</a>, which attempts to unite general relativity with quantum theory, is juggling with scales and energies well beyond anything experimentally accessible, but still there\u2019s a clear motive: to reconcile two mutually incompatible ideas. Quantum theory itself is startlingly accurate with its predictions but current research into its underlying principles is motivated largely just because it appears so bizarre. It works but scientists want to\u00a0know why.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-explained\">Explain it to me like I'm a kid: scientists try to make sense of gravitational waves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By contrast, Einstein seemed to invent general relativity simply because he wanted to \u2013 because he saw questions where others didn\u2019t.</p> <p>A more pertinent question, perhaps, is whether any young scientist could do that today. Einstein\u2019s \u201cmiraculous year\u201d of 1905, in which he not only deduced special relativity but also kick-started quantum theory and published several other ground-breaking papers, was an unrivalled creative burst. Yet any scientist\u2019s early career is often their most productive time, as it was with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/hawking\" title=\"\">Stephen Hawking</a>. Today, however, it\u2019s instead likely to be the most constrained and fraught.</p> <p>Young scientists now need more than ever to publish lots and quickly, to get grants and tenure, to justify the \u201cimpact\u201d of their work, and to carve out a niche for themselves, often in a highly specialised area. There is scant opportunity to just sit at a desk and ponder big questions.</p> <p>A century ago, general relativity had no obvious \u201cimpact\u201d, even though the GPS systems in today\u2019s smartphones rely on it. It didn\u2019t even have a clear goal, except intellectually. If Einstein\u2019s project had relied on a grant application today, it would surely be rejected; probably no young scientist could afford the luxury of contemplating it in the first place. It\u2019s not clear there is a space for Einsteins in modern science any longer.</p>",

It\u2019s an extended meditation, written in old age by a scion of one of Boston\u2019s elite families, on how the world had changed in his lifetime, and how his formal education had not prepared him for the events through which he had lived. This education had been grounded in the classics, history and literature, and had rendered him incapable, he said, of dealing with the impact of science and technology.</p> <p>Re-reading Adams recently left me with the thought that there is now an opening for a similar book, <em>The Education of Mark Zuckerberg</em>. It would have an analogous theme, namely how the hero\u2019s education rendered him incapable of understanding the world into which he was born. For although he was supposed to be majoring in psychology at Harvard, the young Zuckerberg mostly took computer science classes until he started Facebook and dropped out. And it turns out that this half-baked education has left him bewildered and rudderless in a culturally complex and politically polarised world.</p> <p>What is intriguing about the Facebook founder is his astonishing blend of high intelligence, naivety and hubris. In February, when it finally began to dawn on him that the election of Donald Trump might tell us something significant and disturbing about the state of the US society, he wrote a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10103508221158471/\" title=\"\">lengthy epistle</a> to his 86 million disciples.</p> <p>\u201cToday,\u201d it began, \u201cI want to focus on the most important question of all: are we building the world we all want?\u201d Ponder that for a moment: note the imperial, hubristic \u201cwe\u201d and the implicit assumption that it is possible to build a single world that everyone wants. It comes straight out of the Ladybird book of democracy. The epistle continues in the same vein. \u201cProgress now requires humanity coming together, not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.\u201d And of course Facebook would provide just such a community: after all, it already has more than 2\u00a0billion users, which is significantly more people than there are in China.</p> <p>When it began to dawn on people that the powerful ad-targeting machine that Zuckerberg and his associates had built might also have been used to nudge voters towards Trump and away from Clinton, Zuckerberg\u2019s response was a mixture of denial and incredulity. Then, as the evidence mounted that his machine had indeed been \u201cweaponised\u201d by political actors to send so-called \u201cdark posts\u201d to individual users, he pivoted rapidly from incredulity to scepticism and then \u2013 as the evidence became incontrovertible \u2013 to technocratic determination to \u201csolve\u201d the problem. In between, he took consolation from the fact that since everyone was now angry with Facebook, the company must be doing something right. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104067130714241\" title=\"\">Trump says Facebook is against him,</a>\u201d he wrote. \u201cLiberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don\u2019t like.

And therein lies a puzzle. For we know that the lad isn\u2019t stupid. Why then is he apparently behaving like an idiot? The answer is that he cannot come clean about the root of the problem, because to do so would reveal the unpalatable truth that it\u2019s a product of Facebook\u2019s business model.</p> <p>Facebook, like Google, is an extractive company, rather like ExxonMobil or Glencore. It \u201cmines\u201d, refines, aggregates and sells its users\u2019 personal information and data trails to advertisers, who then use it to target ads at said users. This data is clearly valuable. At the moment, for example, the company earns nearly <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/facebook-almost-20-per-user-us-and-canada-q4-2017-2\" title=\"\">$20 per user per year</a> (in the US and Canada, anyway) by monetising their data. The downside \u2013 from society\u2019s point of view \u2013 is that the targeted system that delivers these revenues is easily manipulated by political actors \u2013 as we saw from the way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/02/facebook-says-up-to-10m-people-saw-ads-bought-by-russian-agency\" title=\"\">Russian interests used it</a> in the 2016 election.</p> <p>Given the largesse that flows from this golden goose, you can see why Zuckerberg is reluctant to do or say anything that might threaten it. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no discussion about alternative business models that might enable the company to survive without undermining democratic processes.

I am such a lucky guy that I cannot be upset with anything. I am upset with nothing. The only thing that upsets me a little bit is the kind of criticism to my players because my players are my players.</p> <p>\u201cI should protect them, I would love to protect them, and from you [media] I can\u2019t. It is something that is completely out of my control. That doesn\u2019t upset me, just gives me a feeling that it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s like when you want to protect people and you can\u2019t. I think it\u2019s a feeling of frustration, but with me it\u2019s fine and with the Einsteins it\u2019s fine.</p> <p>\u201cThe Einsteins need money to live, they can\u2019t coach, they can\u2019t sit on the bench, they can\u2019t win matches. They can speak, they can write, they can criticise the work of other people, but I am a good man. I am good man of goodwill. I do lots of charity, I help so many people, so why not also feed the Einsteins? That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho has recently criticised in public the performances of Jesse Lingard, Luke Shaw, Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Daley Blind. Of this he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a learning process, you make a mistake, especially the kind of individual mistake, you have to learn with what that means for the team, a team that works during the week on a game plan.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes not during the whole week for the same match because now we are having a game every three days - but to try to have a game plan, try to identify some defensive and attacking agreements between all of us, then in the game the individual mistake you can be punished by that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-master\">Manchester United\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: no longer the bright young iconoclast | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt happened to us. We can obviously try to control our own mistakes, that\u2019s what we try all the time. The critique is part of the evolution, the critique is part of the process, the critique helps people to learn how to cope with critics. It\u2019s their life. From you, they cannot expect other thing than be ready to smash them when they have periods of not so much success.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho aimed another dig at his critics when speaking of Saturday\u2019s midday meeting with Leicester City at Old Trafford by mockingly describing himself as the poorest manager ever. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side are the champions and the 53-year-old pointed to his own record in making Chelsea only the second club \u2013 along with United \u2013 to retain the Premier League title.</p> <p>\u201cIt is obviously very difficult to retain the title \u2013 not for Leicester, for everyone \u2013 history says that. Not many teams during the Premier League history they could do that. One of the teams was, of course, Man United, another one was some team managed from the worst manager in the history of football, but it\u2019s really difficult</p> <p>\u201cBut the reality is I look at them and they are very good, they are very good. They won the Premier League because some of the big teams were not good enough last season, but they won because they were very good and they are still very good.</p> <p>\u201cI think they are a very easy team to analyse, a very easy team to understand. Their defensive process is clear, their attacking organisation is very easy to understand, too, but it is very difficult to cope with it. It is very difficult to keep a clean sheet against a team like Leicester and it is difficult to score goals against a team like Leicester. I keep repeating, easy to understand but difficult to play against.\u201d</p>",

Naturally, this sort of thing is liable to make therapists angry. (The correct response is to nod compassionately and ask: \u201cNow, <em>why </em>do you think that makes you so angry?\u201d) As Mark Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/23/therapist-self-help-therapy\">noted in this paper</a>, we should be wary of any finding that seems to suggest governments could save money by telling people to sort themselves out. But the self-help route has another limitation worth bearing in mind: what makes you so confident you even know what your problems really are?</p> <p>Typically, self-help works like this: you\u2019re troubled by some issue \u2013 procrastination, commitment-phobia, depression \u2013 so you seek a\u00a0book to fix it, just as you\u2019d seek a\u00a0spanner or screwdriver if the legs on your kitchen table started wobbling. But minds aren\u2019t like wobbly tables. There\u2019s no reason to\u00a0assume \u2013 actually, <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/every-school-of-psychology-has-its-own-theory-of-the-unconscious\">there\u2019s much reason to doubt</a> \u2013 that we\u2019re in touch with our deepest anxieties and hang-ups. Rather than productivity techniques, maybe you need to face the fact that your job provides no meaning. Maybe accusing yourself of \u201ccommitment-phobia\u201d is\u00a0how you rationalise the subconscious awareness that your partner doesn\u2019t love you. Maybe your depression is best understood not as the result of \u201cautomatic thoughts\u201d, but as a sign that you\u2019re living life to serve your parents\u2019 agenda, instead of your own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/28/stabbing-children-disease-ridden-needles-science-common-sense\">Common sense isn't always that sensible</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Or maybe not: probably, some problems are exactly what they seem. But the question is so personal that the best book in the world can\u2019t help but miss the mark, whereas another human at least stands a chance of hitting it. And if CBT is truly no better than self-help, maybe the right conclusion isn\u2019t that therapists don\u2019t matter, but that CBT isn\u2019t necessarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/07/therapy-wars-revenge-of-freud-cognitive-behavioural-therapy\">the apogee of therapy</a>?</p> <p>Crucially, the point isn\u2019t that therapists are wiser, thus better placed to tell you what your problems are. Rather, a good therapist will throw up roadblocks to your attempts to swiftly define the problem before hurrying on to fix it. This is the kernel of good sense in the cliche of the Freudian shrink who does nothing but rephrase his patient\u2019s comments as questions: he\u2019s refusing them the comfortable option of a one-size-fits-all solution, stubbornly forcing them toward self-understanding. Therapy isn\u2019t the only way to do this: journaling, meditation, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/10/not-self-help-great-advice-life-james-hollis-what-matters-most-jung\">some books</a> are among the others. What they all share is that they throw you back on yourself, blocking the easy but inauthentic alternative of using someone else\u2019s secondhand answer. As Albert Einstein is often quoted as saying, <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/22/solve/\">though he didn\u2019t really say it</a>: \u201cIf I\u00a0had only one hour to save the world, I would spend 55 minutes defining the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Plus, when it comes to psychology, there\u2019s a\u00a0bonus: half the time, a problem truly understood stops being a problem at all.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It is a dazzling cinematic montage of modern times that chews on everything from relativity to Leon Trotsky to the fantastic early films of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. In a series of unapologetically epic and trenchantly emotional installations, Kentridge puts himself \u2013 and his country South Africa \u2013 into a grandiose history of life, the universe and everything, reinventing the shattered perspectives of early 20th-century modernism in an original, funny and profound way.</p> \n<p> History is a mad machine, propelling us ever forward. In Kentridge\u2019s awe-inspiring installation The Refusal of Time, a kind of huge perpetual motion machine \u2013 lovingly crafted out of wood \u2013 cranks its shafts and pumps its pistons while around it films are projected and speakers blare speech and music. But this no mere futurist chaos; there is method to Kentridge\u2019s madness. At the heart of this great speculation is the theory of relativity, which takes as its starting point the fact that light has a constant speed of 299,792,458 metres per second. If the speed of light is constant, explains the voice coming from the agitprop-style loudspeakers, it follows that time cannot be a stable quantity. This insight led to Einstein\u2019s most mind-boggling thoughts, and they inspires Kentridge to imagine human history as a film we can rerun, a sorrow that can be stopped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41474688a920483c6f63ce79f40bbdd41184dd07\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41474688a920483c6f63ce79f40bbdd41184dd07/0_0_4000_2610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Refusal of Time is on show at the Whitechapel Gallery, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Refusal of Time is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Peters/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> At the other end of the exhibition, after climbing a staircase decorated with a portrait drawn in black tape whose image fragments as you ascend, another crazy machine rattles away. This time it\u2019s a propaganda speaker built from flea-market finds that leads you into a bureaucratic office where Trotsky is lamenting the collapse of democracy in the Soviet Union. A Bolshevik commissar and his secretary change into dancing cyborgs, half-human and half-camera, in a sequence that is both a homage to the avant-garde film of revolutionary Russia and an image of a society becoming dehumanised.</p> \n<p> Kentridge\u2019s love of film is joyous, but shadowed. He re-creates M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019s early special-effects classic <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FrdVdKlxUk\">A Voyage to the Moon</a> in what seems a simple celebration of the power of the camera to make magic. But then the film-maker \u2013 Kentridge \u2013 magically invents a dream lover, only for this mysterious woman to vanish like a ghost when he tries to touch her. Art can give and it can take away. It is a touching portrait of the artist as a lonely man.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bee1c7464f15220d10914d33390556c260ebe27f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bee1c7464f15220d10914d33390556c260ebe27f/0_0_7092_5100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Second Hand Reading, 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kentridge\u2019s Second-Hand Reading, 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: William Kentridge/Marian Goodman Gallery, Goodman Galler/Lia Rumma Gallery</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> At least he\u2019s got his drawing.

Do they have an innate gift that just can\u2019t be taught?\u201d</p> <p>The answer, perhaps surprisingly, was no. Prodigious feats of memory such as recalling hundreds of binary digits or a Sherlock-like ability to put a name to a face are likely to be mostly down to hours of training and using the right mnemonic techniques, the scientists concluded.</p> <p>The study, published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30087-9\">Neuron</a>, recruited 23 of the 50 top-scoring memory athletes in an annual contest called the World Memory Championships. The athletes were given 20 minutes to recall a list of 72 random nouns and they scored, on average, nearly 71 of the 72 words. </p> <p>By contrast, an untrained control group recalled an average of 26 words. This group then followed a daily 30-minute training regime where they practiced walking through a chosen familiar environment, such as their own home, and placing objects in specific locations.</p> <p>Simonides was supposedly inspired to develop the \u201cloci\u201d technique after a gruesome tragedy in which a banqueting hall collapsed just after the poet had left the building. Some of his fellow diners were crushed beyond recognition, meaning they could only be identified based on the table plan.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.boriskonrad.de\">Boris Konrad</a>, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich who co-authored the study, said: \u201cYou really walk through a place and then later you visualise the location to place an object there. You\u2019re not just wandering around in your crazy mental palace.\u201d</p> <p>It also helps for the image to be vivid, bizarre and firmly placed in the location.

This kind of \u201cresting state\u201d scan is designed to give a measure of the brain\u2019s connectivity \u2013 essentially a measure of how tightly disparate clusters of neurons are wired together. </p> <p>After training, the background hum of brain activity in the ordinary participants had shifted to more closely match that seen in the champions \u2013 and the closer the resemblance, the better the person\u2019s performance was likely to be.</p> <p> \u201cAfter training we see massively increased performance on memory tests,\u201d said Dresler. \u201cNot only can you induce a behavioural change, the training also induces similar brain connectivity patterns to those seen in memory athletes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would speculate that it reflects activity-dependent rewiring,\u201d said M\u00fcller.</p> <p>Konrad believes that \u201cnot everyone can become a champion\u201d \u2013 even within the trained group some people fared far better than others. \u201cBut everyone using the technique can improve quite substantially from the level they\u2019re at,\u201d he added.</p>",

          "body": "<h2><strong>1. His science</strong></h2> <p>Einstein was, first and foremost, a scientist. In 1905 and again in 1916, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/may/07/scientists-prove-einstein-right\">radically revised our understanding of the universe</a>. He was a pictorial thinker who came up with a new, intuitive sense of what reality looked like. Physics at the start of the 20th century was a rather settled endeavour, not seemingly in need of radical revision. We thought light was a wave and that duration, length and mass were objective facts of the world. We thought that space was a flat, Euclidean entity, unaffected by the distribution of matter and energy within it. Einstein, a mere patent clerk when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha\">he first began suggesting differently</a>, showed us that light must be thought of as a particle when it is emitted or absorbed, that matter is composed of atoms, that space is malleable, undulating with the distribution of the stuff within it, that how long or massive an object is or the time order of closely occurring events is not a fact of the world, but merely a fact of our point of view. He showed that these perspectival truths were well-behaved when they were placed in a four-dimensional conceptual framework. Seeing may be believing, but what we should believe about the universe, Einstein demonstrated, requires seeing it from a reference frame beyond that of the human senses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/may/04/einsteins-election-riddle-are-you-in-the-two-per-cent-that-can-solve-it\">Einstein's election riddle: are you in the two per cent that can solve it?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>2. His politics</strong></h2> <p>Einstein joked to his dear friend Max Born that he had a version of the Midas touch: everything he said turned to newsprint. Einstein\u2019s science made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2014/mar/14/albert-einstein-tongue-photography\">him a worldwide celebrity</a>, a status others might have enjoyed, but which Einstein despised. He was no shrinking violet, yet he detested the shallowness and meaningless absurdity that came with his universal adoration. But he realised that it could be handy. He was given a cultural megaphone and he decided that its best use was to amplify the concerns of those whose voices were least heard. Whether it was his own Jewish brethren suffering the insults of antisemitism, African-Americans suffering systematic racism, the poor kept down by structural barriers to advancement, or political dissidents in the Soviet Union who were being repressed, Einstein was unabashedly vocal in trying to change the institutions that led to inequality and injustice. His standing provided him with a unique place to speak for those who were silenced and he made great use of it in the name of universal human dignity.</p> <h2><strong>3. His immodesty</strong></h2> <p>Einstein never lacked confidence. Strengthened by his convictions, he was impervious to the power of those with superior social or professional standing, and resolute in his willingness to state his beliefs publicly. As social psychologists have shown since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/07/social-psychology-group-mentality\">famous experiments of Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram</a>, humans are greatly influenced by the opinions of those around us, especially those who occupy positions of authority. We can shy away from reasonable and ethical beliefs, if we sense that we are in the minority for holding those views. But Einstein stands as an example of intellectual commitment. His revolutionary physical theories and his advocacy for peace at times of war and for better treatment of those in need were often unpopular. Einstein was investigated by the FBI for his views, and he received death threats from Nazi sympathisers. He was threatened with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jan/05/science.schools\">loss of his position at the Institute for Advanced Study</a> for his vocal support for his beliefs and causes. Yet he steadfastly refused to give in to fashion, expedience or groupthink. It is a cliche to say someone has the \u201ccourage of his convictions\u201d, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/05/albert-einstein-archive-genius-doubts-and-loves\">Einstein is a figure of great courage</a> in publicly expounding views he thought correct and morally necessary when such positions were dangerously unpopular.</p> <h2><strong>4. His modesty</strong></h2> <p>Einstein was flummoxed by his public reception. In one famous incident, he was accompanying Charlie Chaplin to the opening of his film <em>City Lights</em> when they were mobbed by thousands of fans. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Einstein asked Chaplin, who replied: \u201cNothing.\u201d We have a cognitive bias that leads us to be more apt to believe the praise we receive and to explain away criticism. We are the focus of our lives and with the contemporary cults of individuality and celebrity, too many people eagerly welcome the spotlight and take it as a sign of their superiority. But Einstein did not seek mass adoration or personal aggrandisement. He was not present to receive his Nobel prize. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/16/israel.india\">He refused the presidency of Israel</a>. He was willing to step into the public eye when it suited his causes, but he was not one to seek fame for the sake of fame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/21/even-albert-einstein-needed-more-than-curiosity-to-become-a-great-physicist\">Even Albert Einstein needed more than curiosity to become a great physicist | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>5. His meaning as a cultural symbol of modernity</strong></h2> <p>I often ask audiences: \u201cWhen I say the name Albert Einstein, what is the first thing that comes to mind?\u201d Regardless of the demographic or the country in which I ask this, inevitably the response is \u201cthe hair\u201d. Here is a man who changed the way the way we see reality, who stared down hatred and stood up for justice, yet despite all of this, the thing we immediately think of is that mane of unkempt, wild white hair. That may seem shallow of us, but I think it is a good thing. What does Einstein\u2019s hair signify? It was a political statement \u2013 he refused to conform to social standards of personal appearance. He was unapologetic in his individuality and unashamed of being different. Growing up a Jew in Wilhelmine Germany, where he was sent to a Catholic school, he was always aware of being an outsider and became not only comfortable with his distance from the mainstream, but took it as a mark of pride. On the one hand, Einstein is the very icon of the genius, someone whose innate intelligence made him radically unlike the masses. But in allowing his hair to become the spectacle it was, he became a symbol that said that special people can come from anywhere, can look like anyone. His physics appeared at a time when the regular order <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jul/17/henri-poincare-einstein-picasso\">was being challenged by modernist movements</a> in mathematics, science, art, religion, governmental and economic structures, even the very sense of what it was to be a human was being reconsidered from its core. Einstein, with his wild hair, signalled that human advancement comes not from the conformity the authorities demand, but from difference \u2013 and that all of us at various times in our lives feel a sense of alienation. Einstein gives us pride in ourselves as individuals who can make a difference; we can revel in free thought, but there is no need in doing so to reject our shared humanity.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Gimbel\u2019s <em>Einstein: His Space and Times</em> is published by Yale.

We are\u00a0oxygen, hydrogen and\u00a0nitrogen, packed together with the carbon that photosynthesising life has plucked, one molecule at a time, from the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. At cremation, our bodies bake down to a handful of minerals. When Hamlet beseeched his too, too solid flesh to melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew, he got it about right: the Prince of Denmark would have been about 70% water, which is itself an atmospheric vapour. And he certainly could have been blown away.</p> <p>Harry Truman \u2013 \u201cnot that Harry Truman\u201d, as Sam Kean says in this bright and breezy book \u2013 was blown away by Mount St Helens. Truman was the defiant man who dismissed the warnings of volcanologists and refused to leave the high slopes of America\u2019s most violent modern volcano before it erupted in May 1980. Kean reconstructs his death because, as a chemist, he knows the temperatures at which water, viscera and bones could vaporise as a black cloud of intense heat, 100 storeys high and 10 miles wide, came roaring down the mountain at 350mph: \u201cTruman\u2019s clothes would have flared and disappeared, and then Truman himself would have sublimed in the scientific sense \u2013 transformed from solid to spirit almost instantly. And with a final hiss, he would have risen up into the air.\u201d</p> <p>As Kean says, there\u2019s a chance that your last breath contained just the tiniest whiff of the late Harry Truman, just as it quite possibly contains a remnant of the air exhaled by Julius Caesar as he cried \u201cEt tu, Brute,\u201d and expired. The atmosphere is vast, but so is the number of atoms and molecules inhaled with each breath: the number of lungfuls in the air and atoms in each lungful run to the billion trillions and more or less match. So each inhalation is also likely to incorporate the last wheeze of a dying tyrannosaurus 70m years ago; and the breath exhaled by Marc Bolan of T Rex as he sang \u201cLife\u2019s a\u00a0Gas\u201d, or by Joey Ramone of the Ramones (who wrote a different song of the same title).</p> <p>Our planet is for the moment an ideal home, solar-powered, air-conditioned, fitted with hot and cold running water and underfloor central heating, but it is the atmosphere that provides the currency with which life pays its way. This book starts with a blood-soaked toga and the conceit of Caesar\u2019s last gasp, but it does truly have an epic story to tell, and Kean takes us at a canter right through the entire 4.5bn year saga, from the moment of planetary assembly, mostly from interstellar gas molecules, to the chaotic challenge of planetary weather, the sorry comedy of\u00a0flying saucers at Roswell and the even more mournful tale of humanoid survivors from spaceship Earth \u2013 should there be any \u2013 in search of another habitable planet a\u00a0dozen light years away.</p> <p>Earth\u2019s first atmosphere during the Hadean period can hardly have been promising: the steamy magmatic exhalations would have been at pressures high enough to crush a human skull, but they cooled to condense into sea. Earth was also hit by another space object big enough to tilt it off its axis, and give it a companion moon: the same collision, says Kean \u201cnot only ejected our atmosphere, it\u00a0may well have boiled our frickin\u2019 oceans\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b00f548b8dea369bb4d202c2ba81d7c17ae49396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b00f548b8dea369bb4d202c2ba81d7c17ae49396/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Nyos, Cameroon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake Nyos, Cameroon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s get this bit out of the way: at times, Kean takes his admirable conversational tone in directions not always familiar to those brought up\u00a0on\u00a0the measured language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/07/evolution-of-birds-from-dinosaurs\" title=\"\">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/09/is-richard-dawkins-destroying-his-reputation\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/01/nigel-calder\" title=\"\">Nigel Calder</a>. So in an aside, the aforementioned Harry Truman \u201cwoke up in the snow in his tighty-whities\u201d; the chemist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/03/fritz-haber-fertiliser-ammonia-centenary\" title=\"\">Fritz Haber </a>\u201cdeveloped one helluva crush\u201d on the\u00a0Kaiser; Humphry Davy tried \u201cchugging a bottle of wine as fast as possible\u201d; Alfred Nobel spilt some \u201cnitro onto a pile of kieselguhr like a\u00a0klutz\u201d and so on.</p> <p>More awkwardly, the whole story \u2013 serious science all the way \u2013 is told in measurements of miles, pounds and Fahrenheit, rather than the metric units now universal in science.</p> <p>Inevitably, some of it is familiar: who could talk about oxygen without invoking Joseph Priestley, or Lavoisier; nitrogen without mentioning Haber, or nitrous oxide without Davy? The numbers, too, are numbing: we don\u2019t think in septillions but that\u2019s the traffic in oxygen molecules consumed by a human in 24 hours in the course of powering muscle movement. The poisonous gas hydrogen sulphide, for instance, makes up a vanishingly small component of the air, but you gulp 60m molecules every four seconds. You never think about the noble gases, but every four seconds you breathe in \u2013 and breathe out \u2013 20 quadrillion molecules of helium and 100 quintillion of argon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Albert Einstein makes an appearance as a fridge designer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The narrative embraces not just the nature of air but the breathtaking qualities of some of its gases, and their connection with human history, so there are enjoyable detours into the story of guano that \u2013 before the Haber-Bosch process \u2013 supplied the nitrogen that fuelled 20th-century food supply; and into the grim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/20/theobserver1\" title=\"\">deaths at Lake Nyos, Cameroon</a>, which in 1986 foamed like soda water, with deadly levels of carbon dioxide that killed 1,746 people. \u201cSurvivors remember an eerie stillness for days afterward.

Albert Einstein makes an appearance as a fridge designer; the nuclear force locked in atomic matter pops up even more forcefully with the atmospheric weapons tests in the Pacific.

My favourite nominates the 832\u00b0F temperature at which brimstone (hell has a lake of it, according to the Revelation of St John the Divine 21:8) remains liquid; and then takes the temperature of heaven (Isaiah 30:26 seems to say the sun shines sevenfold as the light of seven days).

But her scientific knowhow leads to a breakthrough in military technology and opens up the way for contemporary communications methods, such as Bluetooth and wifi.</p> <p>The remarkable life of the Austrian-born Hedy Lamarr \u2013 considered the most beautiful woman in the world by her Hollywood peers in the 1940s and 50s \u2013 is now the subject of a documentary, co-produced by the actress Susan Sarandon, which receives its British premiere in London on Wednesday as part of the <a href=\"http://ukjewishfilm.org/\">Jewish Film Festival</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ukjewishfilm.org/film/bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story/\"><em>Bombshell: the Hedy Lamarr Story</em> </a>follows the career of the young Hedwig Kiesler from her childhood in pre-war Vienna, on to her escape, disguised as a maid, from a rich first husband. Using news footage and interviews with Lamarr\u2019s children from her six marriages, the first-time director Alexandra Dean traces Lamarr\u2019s journey to London and later to Los Angeles, where she becomes a star after appearing with Charles Boyer in the film <em>Algiers</em>. But at the centre of the new documentary is her little-known life as a successful inventor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ec48adff71fe1f9cc79d176332518871ffd18e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ec48adff71fe1f9cc79d176332518871ffd18e8/0_146_2602_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr as Delilah in the Cecil B DeMille\u2019s 1949 biblical blockbuster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hedy Lamarr as Delilah in the Cecil B DeMille\u2019s 1949 biblical blockbuster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film tells Lamarr\u2019s story largely through previously unheard tapes of an interview she gave to <em>Forbes</em> magazine in 1990, 10 years before her death in Florida. By then a recluse, she explains her interest in technology to the journalist. \u201cInventions are easy for me to do,\u201d Lamarr says. \u201cI suppose I just came from a different planet.\u201d</p> <p>Lamarr is best remembered for her sultry role as the duplicitous Delilah in Cecil B DeMille\u2019s 1949 biblical blockbuster, in which she appeared opposite Victor Mature as Samson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2014/jul/15/celebrity-patents-prince-neil-young-albert-einstein\">From Prince's keytar to Bing Crosby's sash window: celebrity patents in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her acting started on stage in Austria, after she had attended a renowned Berlin acting school headed by the director Max Reinhardt. The daughter of a Viennese bank director with a love of technology, Lamarr grew up in an artistic Jewish quarter of the city. By the age of 19 she had won a film role that brought her life-long notoriety, appearing nude in an unprecedented simulated sex scene in the 1933 Czech film <em>Ecstasy</em>, a performance denounced by the pope.</p> <p>Until now, Lamarr\u2019s part in the development of what she called \u201cfrequency hopping\u201d, a way to avoid the German jamming of radio signals, has remained an obscure bit of Hollywood trivia. However, as the Los Angeles film industry is shaken by accusations of in-built sexism in the wake of revelations about producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual abuses, Sarandon and the German film actress Diane Kruger, a fan of Lamarr who appears in the documentary, believe her hidden scientific talent will finally be recognised.</p> <p>Dean told <em>Vanity Fair</em> this year that Lamarr opens the tapes by saying: \u201cI wanted to sell my story \u2026 because it\u2019s so unbelievable. It was the opposite of what people think.\u201d Lamarr also complains about Hollywood\u2019s obsession with appearances, which she found dull: \u201cThe brains of people are more interesting than the looks, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, her roles repeatedly showcased her beauty and offered limited scope for acting. George Sanders, one of her co-stars, once said that Lamarr was \u201cso beautiful that everybody would stop talking when she came into a room\u201d.</p> <p>Her interest in radio communications seems to have been rekindled by the introduction in America of remote control systems for playing music, and by her concern about the German jamming techniques that prevented the use of radio-controlled torpedoes.</p> <p>She worked on her invention of an early form of \u201cspread spectrum\u201d telecommunications \u2013 in which a signal is transmitted on a much broader bandwidth than the original \u2013 together with her Hollywood neighbour, the avantgarde composer George Antheil, through the summer of 1940.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a34b8c924f042e45f68bb20689e50a75a077c04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a34b8c924f042e45f68bb20689e50a75a077c04/0_66_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Sarandon co-produced the documentary, Bombshell: the Hedy Lamarr Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Sarandon co-produced the documentary, <em>Bombshell: the Hedy Lamarr Story.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their joint design employed a mechanism rather like the rolls used inside a pianola, or self-playing piano, to synchronise changes between 88 frequencies \u2013 the standard number of piano keys. The duo submitted a patent to the National Inventors Council on 10 June 1941, and it was granted a year later.</p> <p>While the idea was not entirely new, with German engineers winning patents for related work in 1939 and 1940, the United States navy classified the patent as \u201ctop secret\u201d. It took time, however, for the military to recognise how useful Lamarr and Antheil\u2019s bulky invention might become.</p> <p>After the war, in 1957, engineers at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division adopted it, and the navy began to use it to help transmit the underwater positions of enemy submarines revealed by sonar.</p> <p>In 1998, more than 50 years after their invention, the pair were honoured with an Electronic Frontier Foundation award.</p> <p>The actress, who once commented that her face was her \u201cmisfortune\u201d and \u201ca mask I cannot remove\u201d, may now gain some posthumous recognition as an inventor, but her most lasting legacy is still likely to be the striking features of Disney\u2019s Snow White, a cartoon character modelled on Lamarr.</p> <h2>LAMARR\u2019S LIFE</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, in Vienna, Austria, on 9 November 1913.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married six times including to Friedrich Mandl, an arms dealer, but fled her loveless marriage to be a Hollywood actress.</p> <p><strong>Film career</strong> Big break was a lead role in Gustav Machaty\u2019s <em>Ecstasy</em>, where she became the (probably) first Hollywood star to simulate a female orgasm on screen. The film sparked outrage and was attacked by Pope Pius XI. After leaving her husband she changed her name to Hedy Lamarr, and starred in the Hollywood film, <em>Algiers</em>.

          "body": "<p>Deep underground, in a defunct gold mine in South Dakota, scientists are assembling an array of odd devices: a chamber for holding tonnes of xenon gas; hundreds of light detectors, each capable of pinpointing a single photon; and a vast tank that will be filled with hundreds of gallons of ultra-pure water. The project, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/30/dark-matter-lux-detector-particle\" title=\"\">LZ experiment</a>, has a straightforward aim: it is designed to detect particles of an invisible form of matter \u2013 called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/oct/02/dark-matter-did-we-just-hear-the-most-exciting-phrase-in-science\" title=\"\">dark matter</a> \u2013 as they drift through space.</p> <p>It is thought there is five times more dark matter than normal matter in the universe, although it has yet to be detected directly. Finding it would solve one of science\u2019s most baffling mysteries and explain why galaxies are not ripped apart by stars flying off into deep space.</p> <p>However, many scientists believe time is running out for the hunt, which has lasted 30 years, cost millions of pounds and produced no positive results. The LZ project \u2013 which is halfway through construction \u2013 should be science\u2019s last throw of the dice, they say. \u201cThis generation of detectors should be the last,\u201d said astronomer Stacy McGaugh at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find anything we should accept we are stuck and need to find a different explanation, perhaps by modifying our theories of gravity, to explain the phenomena we attribute to dark matter.\u201d</p> <p>Other researchers reject this view: \u201cTheory indicates we have a really good chance of finding dark matter particles,\u201d said Chamkaur Ghag, chair of the Dark Matter UK consortium. \u201cThis is certainly not the time to talk of giving up.\u201d</p> <p>The concept of dark matter stems from observations made in the 1970s. Astronomers expected to find that stars rotated more slowly around a galaxy the more distant they were from the galaxy\u2019s centre, just as distant planets revolve slowly round the Sun. (Outermost Neptune moves round the Sun at a stately 12,000mph; innermost Mercury does so at 107,082mph.)</p> <p>That prediction was spectacularly undone by observations, however. Stars at a galaxy\u2019s edge orbit almost as fast as those near its centre. According to theory, they should be hurled into space. So astronomers proposed that invisible dark matter must be providing the extra gravity needed to hold galaxies together. Proposed sources of dark matter include burnt-out stars; clouds of dust and gas; and subatomic particles called Wimps \u2013 weakly interacting massive particles. All have since been discounted, except Wimps. Many astronomers are now convinced they permeate space and form halos round galaxies to give them the gravitational \u201cmuscle\u201d needed to hold fast-flying stars in place.</p> <p>Getting close to Wimps has not been easy. Scientists have built increasingly sensitive detectors deeper and deeper underground to protect them from subatomic particles that bombard Earth\u2019s surface and which would trigger spurious signals. These devices resemble huge Russian dolls: a vast metal tank containing water \u2013 to provide added protection against incoming stray particles \u2013 is erected and, within this, a giant sphere of an inert gas such as xenon is suspended. Wimps making it through to the final tank should occasionally strike a xenon nucleus, producing a flash of light that can be pinpointed by electronic detectors.</p> <p>Despite three decades of effort, this approach has had no success, a failure that is starting to worry some researchers. \u201cWe are now building detectors containing more and more xenon and which are a million times more sensitive than those we used to hunt Wimps 30 years ago,\u201d said astrophysicist Professor David Merritt, of the Rochester Institute of Technology, New York. \u201cAnd still we have found nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Last July, scientists reported that after running their Large Underground Xenon (Lux) experiment for 20 months they had still failed to spot a Wimp. Now an upgraded version of Lux is being built \u2013 the LZ detector, a US-UK collaboration \u2013 while other devices in Canada and Italy are set to run searches.</p> <p>The problem facing Wimp hunters is that as their detectors get ever more sensitive, they will start picking up signals from other weakly interacting particles called neutrinos. Tiny, almost massless, these constantly whizz through our planet and our bodies. Neutrinos are not nearly heavy enough to account for the gravitational abnormalities associated with dark matter but are still likely to play havoc with the next generation of Wimp detectors.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the Wimp hypothesis will be truly dead when we reach that point,\u201d said McGaugh. \u201cIt already has serious problems but if we get to the point where we are picking up all this background interaction, the game is up. You will not be able to spot a thing.\u201d</p> <p>This point is rejected by Ghag. \u201cYes, occasionally a neutrino will kick a xenon nucleus and produce a result that resembles a Wimp interaction. We will, initially, be in trouble. But as we characterise the collisions we should find ways to differentiate them and concentrate only on those produced by Wimps.\u201d</p> <p>But there is no guarantee that Wimps \u2013 if they exist \u2013 will ever interact with atoms of normal matter. \u201cYou can imagine a scenario where dark matter particles turn out to be so incredibly weak at interacting with normal matter that our detectors will never see anything,\u201d said cosmologist Andrew Pontzen, of University College London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/26/vera-rubin-pioneering-astronomer-dark-matter-died-aged-88\">Vera Rubin, astronomer who helped find evidence of dark matter, dies at 88</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, it could transpire that a Wimp is completely incapable of interacting with normal matter. \u201cYou would then be saying we can only make sense of the universe by proposing a hypothetical particle that we can never detect,\u201d said Pontzen. \u201cPhilosophically that is a highly unsatisfactory situation. You would be saying you cannot prove or disprove a key hypothesis that underpins scientific\u00a0understanding.\u201d</p> <p>However, Pontzen also pointed out that dark matter has proved invaluable in making scientific predictions and should not be dismissed too quickly. \u201cScientists in the late 20th century attempted to predict what the cosmic background radiation left behind by the Big Bang 13 billion years ago might look like. Those who used dark matter in their calculations were found to have got things spectacularly right when we later flew probes to study that radiation background. It shows there was dark matter right at the birth of the universe.\u201d</p> <p>McGaugh is unconvinced. He points to the failure of Geneva\u2019s Large Hadron Collider, used to find the Higgs boson, to produce particles that might hint at the existence of Wimps. \u201cIt was hailed as the golden test but it has produced nothing, just like the other experiments.\u201d Instead, more effort should be directed to developing new theoretical approaches to understanding gravity, he argues. One such theory is known as modified Newtonian dynamics, or Mond. It suggests that variations in the behaviour of gravity could account for the unexpected star speeds. Such approaches should take precedence if LZ should fail to find dark matter in the next two or three years, McGaugh said.</p> <p>Ghag disagrees. \u201cI think it is ridiculous to suggest we stop,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we just going to say \u2018OK, we have no idea what makes up 85% of the universe just because we are finding it all a bit hard\u2019? That\u2019s not realistic.\u201d</p> <p>The uncertain nature of the problem was summed up by Pontzen. \u201cWe have been looking for dark matter for so long. Sometimes I think I should get real and admit something is up. On the other hand, the technology is getting better and we are opening up new possibilities of where to find dark matter. Which of these scenarios I feel closest to depends what sort of day I am having.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/nov/29/was-einstein-wrong-physicists-challenge-speed-of-light-theory-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5dg92\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2924993\"            data-video-name=\"Was Einstein wrong?

And Schmidhuber is the person who is trying to build their brains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c43957f8fb9c56845ba903a271a7a7e7bc85b92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c43957f8fb9c56845ba903a271a7a7e7bc85b92/0_355_3852_2312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018By 2050, we will have AIs who are more intelligent than we are\u2019 ... a Pepper humanoid robot.

The only problem is that they are still too slow \u2013 around a billion neural connections compared with around 100,000bn in the human cortex.</p> <p>\u201cBut we have a trend whereby our computers are getting 10 times faster every five years, and unless that trend breaks, it will only take 25 years until we have a recurrent neural network comparable with the human brain. We aren\u2019t that many years away from an animal-like intelligence, like that of a crow or a capuchin monkey.\u201d</p> <p>How many years, exactly? \u201cI think years is a better measure than decades, but I wouldn\u2019t want to tie myself down to four or seven.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask how he can be so confident about his timetable, he launches the hyperdrive. Suddenly we are jumping from the big bang to the neolithic revolution, from the invention of gunpowder to the world wide web. Major events in the history of the universe, Schmidhuber says, seem to be happening at exponentially accelerating intervals \u2013 each landmark coming around a quarter of the time of the previous. If you study the pattern, it looks like it is due to converge around the year 2050.</p> <p>\u201cIn the year 2050 time won\u2019t stop, but we will have AIs who are more intelligent than we are and will see little point in getting stuck to our bit of the biosphere. They will want to move history to the next level and march out to where the resources are. In a couple of million years, they will have colonised the Milky Way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d258e83c45c6485869d770afd50df084e1de8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d258e83c45c6485869d770afd50df084e1de8c/0_3_5695_3417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To the stars ... robots will lead the way, says Schmidhuber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To the stars ... robots will lead the way, says Schmidhuber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He describes this point of convergence as \u201comega\u201d, a term first coined by <a href=\"http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-voices/20th-century-ignatian-voices/pierre-teilhard-de-chardin-sj\">Teilhard de Chardin</a>, a French Jesuit priest born in 1888. Schmidhuber says he likes omega \u201cbecause it sounds a bit like \u2018Oh my God\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Schmidhuber\u2019s status as the godfather of machine intelligence is not entirely undisputed. For a computer scientist, he can sometimes sound surprisingly unscientific. During his talk in Berlin, there were audible groans from the back of the audience. When Schmidhuber outlined how robots would eventually leave Earth behind and \u201cenjoy themselves\u201d exploring the universe, a Brazilian neuroscientist interrupted: \u201cIs that what you are saying? That there is an algorithm for fun? You are destroying the scientific method in front of all these people. It\u2019s horrible!\u201d</p> <p>When asked about those reactions, Schmidhuber has that pitying look again. \u201cMy theses have been controversial for decades, so I am used to these standard arguments. But a lot of neuroscientists have no idea what is happening in the world of AI.\u201d</p> <p>But even within the AI community, Schmidhuber has his detractors. When I mentioned his name to people working on artificial intelligence, several said his work was undoubtedly influential and \u201cgetting more so\u201d, but also that he had \u201ca bit of a chip on his shoulder\u201d. Many felt his optimism about the rate of technological progress was unfounded, and possibly dangerous. Far from being the true seer of the robot future, one suggested, Schmidhuber was pushing artificial intelligence to a destiny similar to that of the Segway, a product whose advent was hyped up as a technological revolution akin to the invention of the PC and ended up as a slapstick prop in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO17A8v5yL4\">Paul Blart: Mall Cop</a>.</p> <p>To understand why Schmidhuber yo-yos between prophet and laughing stock, one has to dive deeper into his CV. Born in Munich in 1963, he became interested in robotics during puberty, after picking up rucksacks full of popular science books and sci-fi novels from the nearby library \u2013 Olaf Stapleton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/81969/star-men\">Star Maker</a>, ETA Hoffmann\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/18/sandman-eta-hoffmann-uncanny-essay-freud\">The Sandman</a> and the novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/08/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Stanislaw Lem</a> were particular favourites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691/0_174_1529_917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My wonderful idol\u2019 ...

Schmidhuber reveres Albert Einstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His great hero, \u201cmy wonderful idol\u201d, he says, was <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html\">Albert Einstein</a>. \u201cAt some point I realised I could have even more influence if I built something that is even smarter than myself, or even smarter than Einstein.\u201d He embarked on a degree in mathematics and computer science at Munich\u2019s Technical University, which handed him a professorship at the age of 30.</p> <p>In 1997, Schmidhuber and one of his students, Sepp Hochreiter, wrote a paper that proposed a method for how artificial neural networks \u2013 computer systems that mimic the human brain \u2013 could be boosted with a memory function, by adding loops that interpreted patterns of words or images in the light of previously obtained information. They called it Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).</p> <p>At the time, AI was going through a prolonged \u201cwinter\u201d: technology had failed to live up to the first wave of hype around artificial intelligence, and funding was hard to come by. In the 1960s, the hope had been that machines could be coded top-down to understand the world in all its complexity. If there is a new buzz now, it is around a seemingly simpler idea: that machines could be fitted with an algorithm that is relatively basic, but enables them to gradually learn bottom-up how complex the world really is.</p> <p>In 1997, Schmidhuber\u2019s paper on LSTM was rejected by MIT, but it now looks like one of the key concepts behind a new wave of interest in <a href=\"http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html\">deep learning</a>. In 2015, Google <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2015/07/neon-prescription-or-rather-new.html\">announced</a> it had managed to improve the error rate of its voice recognition software by almost 50% using LSTM. It is the system that powers Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and Apple announced last year that is using LSTM to improve the iPhone.</p> <p>If Schmidhuber had his way, the concept would get even more recognition. In a scathing 2015 <a href=\"http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-conspiracy.html\">article</a>, he complained that the \u201cCanadian\u201d trio of computer scientists hailed in Silicon Valley as the superstars of AI \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2015/7/15/11614684/ai-conspiracy-the-scientists-behind-deep-learning\">Geoffrey Hinton (Google), Yann Lecun (Facebook) and Yoshua Bengio (IBM)</a> \u2013 \u201cheavily cite each other\u201d, but \u201cfail to credit the pioneers of the field\u201d.</p> <p>During his talk in Berlin and our interview, he repeats emphatically, at regular intervals, like a jingle crashing through your Spotify stream, that the current buzz around computer learning is \u201cold hat\u201d and that LSTM got there many years earlier. He is quick to talk down the importance of Silicon Valley, which he feels is so dominated by \u201ccut-throat competition\u201d that it produces less value for money than European institutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b295f1c9d47d4e21463c51b568588f2dd055627a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b295f1c9d47d4e21463c51b568588f2dd055627a/0_66_2000_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Matrix ... \u2018the most idiotic plot of all time,\u2019 says Schmidhuber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Matrix ... \u2018the most idiotic plot of all time,\u2019 says Schmidhuber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One possibility that presents itself when listening to Schmidhuber talk about the future of robotics is that his relentless techno utopianism is simply a strategy to make sure he doesn\u2019t end up as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/07/popandrock1\">Sixto Rodriguez</a> of AI, influential but overlooked while the Silicon Valley Dylans go down in the hall of fame.</p> <p>And relentless it is. Given his interest in sci-fi, has he never worried that robots will enslave and rule over us once they become self aware? Schmidhuber shakes his head. \u201cWe won\u2019t be enslaved, at the very least because we are very badly suited as slaves for someone who could just build robots that are far superior to us.\u201d He dismisses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAAV9a4wwEA\">The Matrix</a>, in which imprisoned humans are used to power AIs: \u201cThat was the most idiotic plot of all time. Why would you use human bioenergy to power robots when a power station that keeps them alive produces so much more energy?\u201d</p> <p>But in that case won\u2019t robots see it as more efficient to wipe out humanity altogether? \u201cLike all scientists, highly intelligent AIs would have a fascination with the origins of life and civilisation. But this fascination will dwindle after a while, just like most people don\u2019t understand the origin of the world nowadays. Generally speaking, our best protection will be their lack of interest in us, because most species\u2019 biggest enemy is their own kind. They will pay about as much attention to us as we do to ants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8c18095f5c1fd12ed1219fe962841182214f19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8c18095f5c1fd12ed1219fe962841182214f19a/657_368_2482_5142/483.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A lot of neuroscientists have no idea what is happening in the world of AI.\u2019 Robot\" width=\"483\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A lot of neuroscientists have no idea what is happening in the world of AI.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Cros Garcia - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wonder if the analogy is less comforting than he intends. Surely we sometimes step on ants? Some people even use chemicals to poison entire colonies. \u201cOf course, but that only applies to a minute percentage of the global ant population, and no one seems to have the desire to wipe all ants off the face of this Earth. On the contrary, most of us are pleased when we hear there are still more ants on the planet than humans, and most of them are in the Brazilian jungle somewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWe may be much smarter than ants, but the overall weight of humans on this planet is still comparable to the overall weight of all ants,\u201d he says, citing a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29281253%20http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29281253%20http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29281253\">recently disputed</a> claim by the Harvard professor Edmund O Wilson.</p> <p>Let\u2019s forget about sci-fi, I say. What about more immediate concerns, like robotisation creating mass unemployment? In a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/there-is-a-blind-spot-in-ai-research-1.20805\">recent article</a> in Nature magazine, AI research Kate Crawford and cyberlaw professor Ryan Calo warned that the new wave of excitement about intelligent design was creating dangerous blindspots when it came to the social knock-on effects of replacing humans with robots.</p> <p>Again, Schmidhuber is not unduly concerned. The dawn of the robot future was clear to him when he fathered two daughters at the start of the millennium, he says. \u201cWhat advice do I give them? I tell them: your papa thinks everything will be great, even if there may be ups and downs. Just be prepared to constantly do something new. Be prepared to learn how to learn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHomo ludens has always had a talent for inventing jobs of the non-existential kind. The vast majority of the population is already doing luxury jobs like yours and mine,\u201d he says, nodding towards my notepad. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to predict which kind of jobs will disappear, but it\u2019s difficult to predict which new jobs will be created. Who would have thought in the 1980s that 30 years later there would be people making millions as professional video gamers or YouTube stars?</p> <p>\u201cEven highly respectable jobs in the medical profession will be affected. In 2012 robots started winning competitions when it came to screening cancer with deep neural networks. Does that mean doctors will lose their jobs? Of course not. It just means that the same doctor will treat 10 times as many patients in the same time he used to treat one. Many people will gain cheap access to medical research. Human lives will be saved and lengthened.\u201d</p> <p>Countries with many robots per capita such as Japan, Germany, Korea or Switzerland, he proposes cheerfully, have relatively low unemployment rates. I try to suggest that a truck driver in his 50s who has never heard of JavaScript may not quite share his optimism, but it\u2019s difficult to talk about the concerns of generations, not to say individuals, when arguing with someone who thinks in omega leaps.</p> <p>Whenever you try to drill into Schmidhuber\u2019s optimistic vision of the robot future, you encounter at its core a very simple scenario. When two beings have a conflict of interest, he says, they have two ways to resolve it: either by collaboration or through competition. Yet every time we encounter such a fork in the road in our conversation, collaboration wins out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35a671283532008c208c5c374265fa04e1dd60fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35a671283532008c208c5c374265fa04e1dd60fc/0_309_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018No one seems to have the desire to wipe all ants off the face of this Earth.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018No one seems to have the desire to wipe all ants off the face of this Earth.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I ask him whether robots of the future, on top of being curious and playful, will also be able to fall in love, he agrees, because \u201clove is obviously an extreme form of collaboration. The love life of robots will be polyamorous rather than monogamous: \u201cThere will be all sorts of relationships between robots. They will be able to share part of their minds, which humans currently can\u2019t, or only if they dedicate a lot of time to each other. There will be fusions of the kind that don\u2019t exist among biological organisms.\u201d</p> <p>If love is really just an intense form of collaboration, why does it feel so irrational? Why do we feel lust, or heartbreak? Schmidhuber doesn\u2019t pick up the bait. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got pain sensors, so that robots hurt themselves when they bump into something. And we\u2019ll work out the lust thing eventually. In the end, they amount to the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>What if one company, an Apple or a Google, builds up a monopoly stronghold over the supersmart robots that run the world in the future? He thinks that kind of dystopia, as evoked in Dave Eggers\u2019 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/circle-dave-eggers-review\">The Circle</a>, is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d. Here too collaboration will triumph. \u201cThe central algorithm for intelligence is incredibly short. The algorithm that allows systems to self-improve is perhaps 10 lines of pseudocode. What we are missing at the moment is perhaps just another five lines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we will develop those 10 lines in my little company, but in these times, when even Swiss banking secrecy is nearing its end, it wouldn\u2019t stay there. It would be leaked. Maybe some unknown man somewhere in India will come up with the code and make it accessible to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>If that sounds a little bit Pollyannaish, it\u2019s because Schmidhuber\u2019s own experience \u2013 the initial rejection of LSTM and his pervading distrust of \u201ccut-throat\u201d Silicon Valley \u2013 must have taught him that competition can create losers as well as winners. As disarming as his optimism can be on a personal level, I would feel a lot more comfortable with the idea of the most advanced beings of the future being midwifed by J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber if he was willing to articulate that doubt.</p> <p>He ends our conversation on an apologetic note: \u201cI am sorry you are talking to such a teenager. But I\u2019ve been saying the same things since the 70s and 80s. The only difference is that people are now starting to take me seriously.\u201d</p>",

Far from being unfamiliar with issues relating to \u201cchildren\u2019s safeguarding\u201d, as a head of an inner-city sixth form for eight years, I dealt with just about every pastoral concern from mental health issues to sexual assault, child abuse to suicide attempts. The classes I have taught during my 16 years in secondary education have generally been of fairly mixed ability, with many students requiring extra support. And it is because I have not only knowledge of and passion for my disciplines but also the ability to adapt to learners\u2019 needs (including those beginning or returning to education in their adult years), can empathise with others, and have an appetite for and commitment to hard work, that I have enjoyed a successful and rewarding career in several educational sectors \u2013 and continue to do so. There are many with QTS who have none of the latter qualities, as well as many who do.</p> <p>Of course, enthusiasm and classroom skills are essential, and hopefully rather more than \u201ca little knowledge\u201d. I am not sure why working in the private, higher and adult education sectors is presumed to preclude one from having these qualities.<br /><strong>Dr Claire Seymour</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Last week you ran a brilliant article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jul/25/no-such-thing-as-a-gifted-child-einstein-iq\" title=\"\">on there being no such thing as a \u201cgifted child\u201d</a> (Education, 25 July).

I started teaching in 1972 after a year at Goldmiths doing an art teaching qualification. There we were taught the theory and firmly believed that all children had enormous capacity to learn and develop their ability to achieve whatever they wanted to do in life.

The purer physical and mathematical aspects of time continue to be debated by the great minds of cosmology, and there are excellent books on that subject, from Stephen Hawking\u2019s A Brief History of Time to Richard Muller\u2019s more recent Now: The Physics of Time<em>. </em>But I\u2019ve always been drawn to the more tangible and human questions: how do our cells tell time, and how does that telling seep upward into the neurobiology, psychology, and consciousness of our species? How is it that our smartphones and wristwatches manage to consistently agree on what time it is? And the clocks inside us, how pliable are they? Can they be made to speed up, slow down, go backward? Why does time preoccupy us, and is there anything we can do about it?</p> <p>The search for answers to these questions consumed me for several years as I wrestled them into my latest book, <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/why-time-flies.html\">Why Time Flies: A Mostly Scientific Investigation</a>. What began as an intellectual journey morphed into something between a pastime and an obsession, accompanying me through one job and another, the birth of my children, pre-school, grade school, beach vacations, and countless cancelled dinner dates and blown deadlines. It was meant to be a book about time that I finished on time; it became a meditation on living life and not wanting time to end. Along the way, I read a great many books by other authors that dealt with time in one way or another; these are some of my favourites.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/confessions-14.html#\">Confessions by St Augustine</a><br /></strong>Departing from Zeno, Aristotle, and the other early Greek philosophers who struggled to understand the physics of time, Augustine, writing in the fourth century, was the first to talk about time as an internal experience \u2013 to ask what time is by exploring how it feels to inhabit it. He noted that what we call three tenses are really just shades of one: our present experience of the past (otherwise known as memory); our present experience of the future (anticipation), and our present experience of the present (attention). \u201cIn you, my mind, I measure time,\u201d he wrote \u2013 the credo for any modern scientist studying the perception of time.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong> 2. <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/time-machine-12.html\">The Time Machine by HG Wells</a><br /></strong>Still great after all these years! Unlike other time-travelling characters of late 19th-century literature, Wells\u2019s hero isn\u2019t a passive agent: he has a device with which he aims himself at the moment, past or future, of his choice. Wells was steeped in the latest scientific literature on memory, consciousness, visual perception, suggestion and illusion, and the opening chapter of this novel is effectively a short course on then-current notions of time perception. When the moment arrives to send a model of the time machine on its maiden voyage, it\u2019s the psychologist who flicks the switch.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong> 3. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/time-travel-514189.html\">Time Travel by James Gleick</a><br /></strong>The Time Machine is just the starting point for Gleick\u2019s joyous and engrossing survey of our species\u2019 preoccupation with the (entirely impossible) possibility of time travel. Cyberspace, time capsules, predestination; Dr. Who, Parmenides, Nabokov \u2013 Gleick is at home in every intellectual territory.

But the 10th of a second is fairly new, made accessible in the mid-19th century by advances in clock technology. Candles, a historian at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, recounts the emergence of this tiny yet vital window of time and its profound impact on the sciences, from astronomy to experimental psychology, and on society. Studies of reaction times, for instance, reveal that the speed of thought is not infinite: the impulse to lift a finger doesn\u2019t translate instantaneously into action, and the time lag (yes, about a 10th of a second) enabled scientists for the first time to put consciousness under the proverbial microscope.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\" /></strong></p> <p><strong> 7. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.popmatters.com/122889-cartographies-of-time-a-history-of-the-timeline-by-daniel-rosenberg--2496184563.html\">Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline by Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton</a></strong><br />An entertaining and lush history of humankind\u2019s efforts to visually represent time, from 1450 to the present.

Was it meant to destroy the observatory? Conrad thought so. The building housed a clock that defined Greenwich Mean Time, the standard time for the nation and, since 1884, the baseline for the entire world \u2013 as a symbol of industrialisation and government reach it would have been a tempting target. The evidence is circumstantial, but it was strong enough to fuel his 1907 novel, in which a porn-shop owner and secret government agent named Adolf Verloc is caught up in an anarchist terror plot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/20/top-10-books-about-consciousness\">Top 10 books about consciousness</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong> 9. <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674135864\">The Clockwork Muse by Eviatar Zerubavel</a><br /></strong>An essential guide for any anxiety-prone writer, this book<em> </em>makes the highly useful point that, in terms of actually getting anything done on a day-to-day basis, organising one\u2019s schedule is more important than inspiration.

The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.</p> <p>In the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body\u2019s nervous and hormonal systems.</p> <p>To test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. \u201cBehaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,\u201d Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.</p> <p>Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/28/maximum-human-lifespan-new-research-mortality\">Maximum human lifespan could far exceed 115 years \u2013 new research</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.</p> <p>\u201cThe mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing\u201d said Cai, whose study is published in <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature23282\">Nature</a>.

Just as electric charge can be either positive or negative, matter could, hypothetically, have either positive or negative mass. </p> <p>For an object with negative mass, Newton\u2019s second law of motion, in which a force is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its acceleration (F=ma) would be experienced in reverse.</p> <p>Theoretically, this sounds straightforward, but picturing how this behaviour would work in the real world is bewildering, even for experts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very counterintuitive and weird,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics\">Jon Butterworth</a>, a physicist at University College London, who was not involved in the latest work.</p> <p>For instance, you might expect a ball with negative mass to be repelled from the Earth\u2019s surface, but theory predicts that it would behave just like ordinary matter and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/fact-and-fiction-about-negative-mass\">fall downwards</a>. </p> <p>No fundamental particles with negative mass have ever been discovered, meaning that there have never been any experimental insights into how they might behave \u2013 if, indeed, they exist. The latest study provides a new platform to study this hypothetical form of matter, by showing that under certain precise conditions, normal particles can be made to behave as though they had negative mass.</p> <p>\u201cIt provides another environment to study a fundamental phenomenon that is very peculiar,\u201d said Forbes.</p> <p>The experiment, described in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301\">Physical Review Letters</a>, created the conditions for negative mass by cooling rubidium atoms to just above absolute zero, creating something called a Bose-Einstein condensate.</p> <p>In this cooled state, particles move extremely slowly and, following the principles of quantum mechanics, behave like waves. This state of matter is already known to exhibit strange properties such as superfluidity, in which a liquid can creep up the sides of jars and over the top. </p> <p>The cooling was achieved by using lasers to slow the particles until they were confined in a laser trap, less than 100 microns across. Breaking the trap causes the rubidium atoms to rush out, expanding in a spherical formation.</p> <p>However, when researchers applied a second set of lasers that kicked the atoms back and forth within the trap, they started to behave as though they had negative mass on exiting the trap.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you push, it accelerates backwards,\u201d said Forbes, who acted as a theorist analysing the system. \u201cIt looks like the rubidium hits an invisible wall.\u201d</p> <p>Martin McCall, a professor of theoretical optics at Imperial College London, described the paper as a neat demonstration of a system exhibiting \u201ceffective negative mass\u201d \u2013 something that has only rarely been created before in laboratory conditions.</p> <p>But does it tell us anything about the possibility of cosmological wormholes or how hypothetical exotic particles might behave? \u201cPersonally I doubt it,\u201d said McCall. </p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

Amid fears that there may have been foreign tampering with electronic voting systems, half a dozen academics and experts joined the suit to testify that recounting by hand would produce a \u201cmore correct result and change the outcome of the election\u201d, the suit said. </p> <p>The Green party presidential candidate has led a campaign, backed by crowdsourced fundraising, to have the votes in the crucial states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania recounted. Her campaign has faced several roadblocks since she filed the first call for a recount in Wisconsin on Friday, as she may have missed the deadline for a recount in several counties in Pennsylvania and the state of Wisconsin is requesting $3.5m, more than the originally estimated $1m, by the end of Tuesday. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/29/security-experts-join-jill-steins-election-changing-recount-campaign\">Security experts join Jill Stein\u2019s \u2018election changing\u2019 recount campaign</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/25/jill-stein-calls-for-recount-in-order-to-verify-us-election-result-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5dxvh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2913830\"            data-video-name=\"Jill Stein calls for recount in order to verify US election result \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Facebook/Jill Stein\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-583887abe4b0cc60d3477172\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/25/161125jillstein2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/25/161125jillstein2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/25/161125jillstein2_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/25/jill-stein-calls-for-recount-in-order-to-verify-us-election-result-video\">Jill Stein calls for recount in order to verify US election result</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Trump picks health secretary</h2> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has chosen a prominent critic of Obamacare as his secretary of health and human services, casting fresh doubt over the future of the Affordable Care Act. Congressman Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon who has long been a leading congressional voice in opposition to Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reform legislation, was confirmed on Tuesday as the president-elect\u2019s pick.

Bannon, who has a record of promoting antisemitic, anti-Muslim and misogynistic content while overseeing the \u201calt-right\u201d website Breitbart News, made money through an early investment in Seinfeld, and later took to writing and producing his own films, including Hillary: The Movie and the Sarah Palin biopic The Undefeated. Bannon\u2019s \u201cmovies aim to give the illusion of authority and thoroughness, and they dig deep into the negatives on their enemies (Clinton Cash) and the positives on their idols (Palin biopic The Undefeated)\u201d, Patterson writes, \u201cwithout ever offering countervailing opinions or contrary evidence. No alternative opinion is wanted or sought.

Frank says this election was a rebuke of centrist policies, which are predicated on the promise of victory, and implores Democrats to learn this lesson and pivot to the left.
