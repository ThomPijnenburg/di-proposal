I\u2019d been part of the <a href=\"http://www.clevelandplayhouse.com/\">Cleveland Play House</a>\u2019s first children\u2019s group, <a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2011/05/curtain_pullers_set_the_stage.html\">along with Paul Newman and Joel Grey</a>. Shirley Temple was famous and mothers all wanted their daughters to be stars.</p> <p>One weekend, two friends making a documentary told me they were driving to New Jersey to interview Albert Einstein, hoping he\u2019d say something against nuclear bombs. This was not long after Hiroshima. On the way, they gave me a 35mm camera and told me to take pictures while they filmed. I\u2019d no idea what I was doing. I\u2019d never used a 35mm before so they had to give me a quick lesson in the back of the car. </p> <p>Einstein was wonderful. He came to the door in baggy tracksuit trousers and sweatshirt. He was so at ease he made us all feel relaxed, too. My friends filmed and I took pictures. Afterwards, I handed over the film, they sent me a couple of prints, and I didn\u2019t think much more of it. The pictures appear grainy but they really capture the atmosphere that day in Einstein\u2019s lounge, as he spoke out strongly against atomic weapons.</p> <p>A few months later, I went to Paris with a friend and worked as a singer at Chez Carr\u00e8re, an exclusive dining club off the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/dec/18/edith-piaf-at-100-the-singer-who-defined-parisian-courage\">Edith Piaf</a> would arrive with her huge entourage, which included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/19/charles-aznavour-i-wanted-to-break-every-taboo\">Charles Aznavour</a>, and we\u2019d all go back to her house in the Bois de Boulogne for breakfast.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/apr/29/the-chic-and-the-shabby-paris-in-the-1950s-by-marilyn-stafford\">The chic and the shabby: Paris in the 1950s by Marilyn Stafford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a fantastic time to be in Paris. I met so many people. One evening at Chez Carr\u00e8re I was invited to join Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s table. Another time, Bing Crosby asked me to the races at Longchamp. It was the start of a great friendship.</p> <p>I\u2019d take a camera with me everywhere and do \u201chappy snaps\u201d, but even then it didn\u2019t cross my mind to become a professional photographer until I lost my voice and realised I couldn\u2019t go on singing. I hinted to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/robert-capa\">Robert Capa</a>, who I\u2019d been introduced to with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/20/henri-cartier-bresson-exhibition-pompidou-centre-communist\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>, that I\u2019d love to try my hand. I was a bit shy about asking: they were gods. Capa suggested I do some war photography. </p> <p>I really didn\u2019t want to go to war, though. So, at Cartier-Bresson\u2019s suggestion, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/apr/29/the-chic-and-the-shabby-paris-in-the-1950s-by-marilyn-stafford\">I began taking pictures in the streets</a>. I discovered a slum near the Bastille and took a lot of photos there and also did some fashion work. I wasn\u2019t much interested in the clothes but I loved taking the models out into the streets. That simply wasn\u2019t done back then.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had a wonderful life and have wonderful memories. These days, I want to help other young female photographers, which is why I started the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fotodocument.org/fotoreportage-award/\">Marilyn Stafford FotoReportage award</a>. There were only 10 female photographers on Fleet Street when I came to England and, although there are more now, the balance is still unequal.</p> <p>This was the very first picture I ever took. So it was quite by accident, and thanks to Albert Einstein, that I became a photographer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"993ad889f805d165480940fc47b6479ce8bf0d9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/993ad889f805d165480940fc47b6479ce8bf0d9f/970_220_1490_1490/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn Stafford in Paris in the 1950s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marilyn Stafford in Paris in the 1950s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gene Fenn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Marilyn Stafford\u2019s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>1925 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.</p> <p><strong>Trained</strong><strong>:</strong> Mentored by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa.</p> <p><strong>Influences</strong><strong>:</strong> Dust bowl photographs by Dorothea Lange; the work of Cartier-Bresson and Capa; Life magazine.</p> <p><strong>Low point</strong><strong>:</strong> \u201cThe imbalance of women to men in documentary photography.\u201d</p> <p><strong>High points</strong><strong>:</strong> \u201cMy first front page in 1958 with Algerian refugees; and meeting Albert Einstein.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Top tip:</strong> \u201cLearn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>One of the advertising world\u2019s most celebrated contrarians, Sir John Hegarty is still railing against conformity after more than 50 years at the forefront of the industry. The co-founder of ad agency <a href=\"http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/\">BBH</a> and creator of acclaimed campaigns for brands such as Levi\u2019s, Audi, BA and Johnnie Walker, Hegarty believes that the propensity for groupthink in the modern workplace can kill off creativity. </p> <p>\u201cNo great idea has ever come out of a brainstorm meeting,\u201d Hegarty says. The trouble with brainstorms, he believes, is that they operate at \u201cthe speed of the slowest person in the room\u201d. \u201cEinstein didn\u2019t work in a brainstorm session,\u201d he adds. He sees parallels between brainstorming and communism. \u201cGermany got the BMW, while East Germany got brainstorm sessions and the Trabant. Who wants a fucking Trabant?\u201d</p> <p>Hegarty, who runs a startup incubator the <a href=\"http://www.thegaragesoho.london/\">The Garage Soho</a>, was speaking at an event hosted by the Guardian Small Business Network at <a href=\"http://sohoworks.com/\">Soho Works</a>, a co-working space in Shoreditch, London. <br /></p> <p>As guest speaker at the event he explained his approach to creativity \u2013 which he defines as \u201can expression of self\u201d. He told the audience: \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re designing packs for Tesco or you\u2019re making a movie, what you do, your creativity, is an expression of you.\u201d</p> <p>Hegarty has made a career out of challenging conventions. His first ad campaign for Levi\u2019s, launched in 1982 the year he co-founded BBH, showed a black sheep among a herd of white sheep moving in the other direction with the tagline \u201cwhen the world zigs, zag\u201d \u2013 words which went on to become the agency\u2019s mantra. Hegarty was behind Levi\u2019s most famous TV ads, including commercials featuring model <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q56M5OZS1A8\">Nick Kamen</a> and the head-banging yellow puppet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLlKYF2L0d8\">Flat Eric</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Paul McCartney breaks up with John Lennon and ends up writing the fucking frog song</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His advice to anyone wanting a long and successful creative career is to pay more attention to the world around them. \u201cIf you\u2019re a creative person, remove the headphones,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re listening to the latest tracks as you walk down the road and think you look cool ... All these ideas are coming into you all the time, if you cut yourself off you are reducing and limiting your ability to survive.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Spending your time staring at a screen won\u2019t help either. \u201cEverybody else is looking at a computer screen,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do things other people aren\u2019t doing.\u201d Hegarty is also not a fan of the beanbag chairs that are often a feature of workspaces in the creative industries. \u201cThe last place anybody is going to have an idea is sitting on a beanbag. You\u2019ll fall asleep on a beanbag.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He warns that cynicism will crush creative ambition, saying that everyone, from novelists to fashion designers, needs to believe in what they are doing. \u201cGreat creative people are optimists,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Another way to prolong your career is to surround yourself with people who are unafraid to disagree with you, no matter how successful you get. \u201cYou become distanced from the people you can really count on because that is what success does,\u201d he says. Hegarty calls this \u201cMcCartney syndrome\u201d. \u201cPaul McCartney wrote some of the greatest songs. Then he breaks up with John Lennon and ends up writing the fucking frog song. He didn\u2019t have Lennon saying to him \u2018Hey Paul ... that\u2019s shite\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>After running BBH for over 30 years, Hegarty has turned his attention to the next generation of entrepreneurs with the incubator for seed stage companies he co-founded alongside venture capitalist Tom Teichman in 2014. The startups backed by The Garage include the online mattress retailer <a href=\"https://simbasleep.com/?gclid=CKje15qFuNQCFQEA0wodME0C-w\">Simba</a> and property technology business <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.settled.co.uk/\">Settled</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter how great your idea is, within no time at all somebody will have copied it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hegarty says he and his team look for startups that disrupt a current model and offer a product or service that makes life easier. \u201cThere are core principles if you\u2019re thinking of setting up a business. Is it going to disrupt a current market, is it scalable and is it monetisable?,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of people who come to us with a great idea and we ask them how do you make money out of that, and they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>The Garage\u2019s motto is \u201cdon\u2019t start a business, build a brand\u201d. He explains: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how great your idea is or how brilliant the technology, within no time at all somebody will have copied it ... What you\u2019ve got to do is build an interesting brand because a brand will protect you from competitive pressure.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In his talk, Hegarty championed the importance of the idea and its power to change the world, saying: \u201cAnybody can have an idea, you don\u2019t need special equipment or special training or special permission, unless you live in North Korea.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Answering an audience member\u2019s question on the challenges facing traditional advertising agencies in the digital age, he said: \u201cI hear people in advertising saying there\u2019s no point because nobody\u2019s watching ads any more \u2013 that\u2019s just stupid. </p> <p>\u201cArchitects haven\u2019t gone \u2018Jesus, it\u2019s too difficult to put up interesting buildings any more so let\u2019s give up\u2019 ...

Did he worry about falling into the traditional biopic trap of signposting the big moments? \u201cThe thing about Einstein is that his life story doesn\u2019t really fit into a movie narrative,\u201d says Howard. \u201cTelevision allows us to take risks with the structure of the story by telling it in a nonlinear way. That shifting between the experiences of the older Einstein and the younger was really important to us \u2013 it lets people know that we weren\u2019t trying to approach his life in a conventional or particularly safe way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0789a91a04a591fc8d89cc917f72d675d060639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0789a91a04a591fc8d89cc917f72d675d060639/141_130_1825_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Einstein and his second wife Elsa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Einstein and his second wife Elsa in 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rush agrees: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a story with Eureka! moments,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many little corners to this guy\u2019s life and those are what the series is most interested to explore.\u201d</p> <p>Most of all it\u2019s a series about personality. Isaacson\u2019s book memorably describes Einstein as \u201ca loner with an intimate bond to humanity, a rebel who was suffused with reverence\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a description with which Flynn agrees. \u201cWhen I read Isaacson\u2019s book what struck me was his rebelliousness. He went to university off his own back because his father\u2019s not really supporting and he\u2019s proud in his identity,\u201d he says. \u201cHe really knows who he is. At that stage in his university career he\u2019s very charismatic \u2013 he\u2019s more like [French poet] Rimbaud.\u201d</p> <p>Howard was also keen not to ignore the darker aspects of the scientist\u2019s life: his failed first marriage, his issues with fidelity, the guilt he felt about surviving war when countless others didn\u2019t, his complicated relationship with Judaism, his conflicted feelings over the development of the atomic bomb. The series is particularly good about Einstein\u2019s relationships with his two wives: scientist Mileva Mari\u0107 (played by Samantha Colley) whom he loved intensely but divorced in 1919, and Elsa (Emily Watson), his first cousin who appeared happy to play second fiddle to a genius, bolstering his ideas and helping to build his celebrity.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t shy away from the complexities of the relationship between Einstein and Mileva and how much she contributed to his early career,\u201d says Colley. \u201cShe had such courage and determination and was a trailblazer for female education and a great scientist in her own right. Yet she ends up keeping house and becoming a mother and it\u2019s sort of a death by a thousand cuts.</p> <p>\u201cThe debates about how much she contributed to Albert\u2019s work are particularly interesting because even now women are too often sidelined and don\u2019t push for the credit they deserve.\u201d</p> <p>Mari\u0107\u2019s sad trajectory from celebrated trailblazer to depressed housewife isn\u2019t the only part of the Einstein story that the makers believe will strike a chord with modern viewers. \u201cHe\u2019s living in a time when the world is moving to the right and totalitarianism is on the rise and global conflict is looming within another generation. It does resonate, absolutely,\u201d says Rush.</p> <p>Howard agrees. \u201cWhen you think how close he came to not sharing his gifts with the world because of his religion, the politics of the time, the narrow-minded institutional thinking, the nationalism \u2026 it\u2019s troubling that decades later those themes still feel so relevant.\u201d</p> <p>So too does Einstein\u2019s celebrity status in later life, a celebrity that the scientist found thrust upon him rather than embracing. \u201cThere is this whole theme about how do you cope with becoming a\u00a0celebrity, with being world famous and\u00a0as much of a household name as\u00a0Charlie Chaplin but you\u2019re a theoretical scientist,\u201d says Rush. \u201cStephen Hawking today is probably the closest example.\u201d</p> <p>National Geographic has conceived <em>Genius</em> as an anthology series with a new \u201cgenius\u201d in the spotlight each season. Do they have an idea of who will be next? \u201cWe\u2019re narrowing it down,\u201d says Howard. \u201cWhat made Einstein so perfect was that his life has so many surprises that allowed for a dramatically compelling and watchable tale.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I can say is we are looking for subjects where we can offer something fresh in the telling. We won\u2019t always go for the most obvious choice.\u201d</p> <p><em>Genius: Albert Einstein begins on National Geographic at 9pm on 23 April</em></p>",

A man celebrated for his extraordinary mind is busy stimulating a different part of his body: his pants are around his ankles and, in the throes of passion, his lover Betty (Charity Wakefield) is pressed against a blackboard strewn with chalk-drawn calculations. </p> <p>Wowza. I wasn\u2019t expecting Einstein After Dark. It\u2019s a racy introduction to another, perhaps predictably excellent performance from Rush, who since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2013/dec/27/shine-rewatching-classic-australian-films\">his breakthrough in 1996\u2019s Shine</a> as the tormented pianist David Helfgott, has been attracted to eccentric genius characters like a moth to the light. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/15/albert-einstein-genius-hidden-sides-national-geographic-drama-geoffrey-rush-emily-watson\">Dreamer, rebel, lover: the hidden sides of Albert Einstein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this moment is intended to slow the pace down, not speed it up. It is positively tame compared with the scene prior, in which gun-toting fascists murder innocents then throw a high-powered explosive in their car, prompting a spectacular <em>kablammo! </em>aerial shot. <br /></p> <p>The director of the first episode, Ron Howard (also a co-developer), then zooms into a closeup of a newspaper on the back seat of the burning vehicle. This shot continues unbroken; next thing we know Betty\u2019s hand is pressed against it and we hear moaning and panting. Howard has transitioned to the next scene \u2013 the site of Einstein with his pants down \u2013 without cutting. <br /></p> <p>What an intro! And they say pedagogical treatments and intertidal systems are only for squares. For a moment I wondered whether Genius was actually inspired by its subject\u2019s life and work, or instead that famous photograph of him sticking his tongue out \u2013 the National Geographic audience punk\u2019d into thinking this was going to be about, you know, science and stuff. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26407bfb24dae7f6657e4b61cca1d171721bd3d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26407bfb24dae7f6657e4b61cca1d171721bd3d7/0_0_800_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Watson\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Watson plays Elsa Einstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dusan Martincek/National Geographic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It doesn\u2019t take long before the star of the show starts lecturing people, a habit he maintains throughout the running time, with various audiences and in various scenarios. Betty is the first to cop it. Einstein hectors her about having \u201cblind faith in authority\u201d when she rejects his proposal to move in with her on the hardly unreasonable grounds they would have to share the house with Albert\u2019s second wife Elsa (Emily Watson). <br /></p> <p>\u201cFor a man who is an expert on the universe you don\u2019t know the first thing about people, do you?\u201d she fires back. That line suggests some rather on-the-nose drama is in store, but thankfully Howard and his team mostly resist lazy or hackneyed storytelling \u2013 notwithstanding a few similarly histrionic contrivances in the dialogue. Genius is a sassy, robust ride: whiplash-smart and littered with imaginative visual connections such as the aforementioned single-shot transition. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"925c414ce5e83a45b86a81b12d523f4dbde3e995\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925c414ce5e83a45b86a81b12d523f4dbde3e995/0_0_800_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"Shannon Tarbet as Marie Winteler and Johnny Flynn as young Albert Einstein\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Tarbet as Marie Winteler and Johnny Flynn as young Albert Einstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/National Geographic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Rush\u2019s frizzy-haired mug is the face stamped across the marketing images, but leading-man status is shared with the British actor Johnny Flynn. Flynn holds his own against the Oscar winner as a younger, university-enrolled Einstein finding his way through life, butting heads against stuffy academics and protesting entrenched ways of thinking. In the Geoffrey Rush, 1922-onwards timeline, the rise of Nazism bubbles in the background, occasionally boiling over into heated confrontation.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/18/hugo-weaving-on-revisiting-the-matrix-they-would-start-again-with-different-actors\">Hugo Weaving on revisiting The Matrix: 'They would start again with different actors'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second episode, directed by Minkie Spiro (Call the Midwife, Downton Abbey) focuses on Einstein\u2019s relationship with a fellow student \u2013 and future first wife \u2013 Mileva Maric (Samantha Cooley), at the Zurich Polytechnic Institute. Spiro and the screenwriters not only give her real agency (boosted by a prickly, scenery-chewing performance from Cooley) but frame the episode from Maric\u2019s perspective, with flashbacks depicting her struggles against the patriarchy. </p> <p>In doing so, the Geoffrey Rush timeline is removed from episode two. It\u2019s a bold move, lending Genius\u2019 structure an erratic quality at the point most shows want to find a steady pace and settle in for the long haul. The first two episodes form the extent of this review; no doubt Rush will return \u2013 pants on or off \u2013 in subsequent offerings. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Genius is showing on National Geographic, Mondays at 8.30pm from 24 April</em></p>",

          "body": "<p>Some university professors have always made it their mission to keep their students out of the pub. Professor Eugene Terentjev, head of science at Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, last week provided a spectacular example of this impulse, in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-41899293\" title=\"\">a note sent to his new intake of undergraduates</a> who, he had observed, like a drink.</p> <p>Professor Terentjev\u2019s letter ran as follows: \u201cPlease be careful how you handle yourselves here; remember you are NOT at any other uni, where students do drink a lot and do have what they regard as a \u2018good time\u2019 \u2013 and you are NOT on a course, as some Cambridge courses sadly are, where such a behaviour pattern is possible or acceptable. Physical sciences is a VERY hard subject, which will require ALL of your attention and your FULL brain capacity (and for a large fraction of you even that will not be quite enough)\u2026 People who just TAKE the course, but enjoy their social life, can easily survive in many subjects, but not in this one\u2026\u201d</p> <p>No doubt Professor Terentjev\u2019s intent with all those admonishing capital letters was to inspire his students to a path of righteousness: a social life was for losers. Not surprisingly, however, his welcome note proved distinctly unwelcome to many. A spokesperson for the Cambridge branch of Student Minds, a mental health charity, argued that the message would encourage \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d, that sense among students that they were not worthy of a place, with all its damaging psychological consequences. Again, not surprisingly, some commentators, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5060169/Fury-Cambridge-don-tells-students-stop-drinking.html\" title=\"\">notably in the <em>Daily Mail</em></a>, saw this latter response as further evidence of seditious \u201csnowflake\u201d tendencies within our universities. \u201cSurely students are there to work?\u201d the outrage ran.</p> <p>Charitably, you could argue that Professor Terentjev\u2019s message showed an underlying concern about his students\u2019 welfare: heavy drinking was probably at least as likely to undermine their mental health as overwork. But in other ways, for a man of science, his analysis sounded curiously flawed.</p> <p>For a start, the impression he gave that such behaviour is on the increase goes against both the grape and grain of wider data. One of the more striking findings in the Office for National Statistics <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/bulletins/opinionsandlifestylesurveyadultdrinkinghabitsingreatbritain/2005to2016#main-points\" title=\"\">study of British social attitudes</a> published this year was that young adults are much more likely to be teetotal than any older age group. More than a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds do not drink at all, compared with just over a fifth of the broader adult population.</p> <p>I saw some evidence of this myself recently when I was writing a story about freshers\u2019 week at Edge Hill University. Partly because the level of fees had concentrated undergraduate minds, there seemed an unusual earnestness about the new intake. A\u00a0student union president told me her key aim for the introductory week was to have \u201cat least as many non-alcohol as alcohol events\u201d, while a university chancellor offered two observations of a new sobriety. \u201cThe bars are empty and you can\u2019t get a seat in the library,\u201d one student rep had lamented to her, while a cleaner in the halls of residence insisted that students seemed so much more diligent. Her evidence? \u201cThere is no sick in the bins any more.\u201d</p> <p>Another apparent misconception in the professor\u2019s remarks \u2013 that any kind of enjoyable social life would make it impossible to survive his course \u2013 sounded even more wrongheaded. We live in a country <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/which-european-countries-work-the-longest-hours/\" title=\"\">high in European league tables for working hours</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/2015#main-points\" title=\"\">low in terms of productivity</a>. Those habits are often ingrained in an education and exam culture that prioritises grind over balance. <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/\" title=\"\">Bertrand Russell\u2019s famous contention</a> that human brains are capable of no more than four hours a day of serious concentration, and that the rest is best spent idling, is borne out in much of the recent science.</p> <p>Recent studies of work suggest that all <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96c85ab8-77fc-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7\" title=\"\">productivity declines sharply after 50 hours a week</a> and that the most <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mental-downtime/\" title=\"\">productive brains need about 20 minutes of inactivity</a> for every useful hour. Crucially, the longitudinal studies show that the single key component of an engaged and productive life is the ability to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3051290/why-having-friends-at-work-is-so-important\" title=\"\">forge and maintain strong friendship groups</a>. Everything else flows from that. Professor Terentjev appears to propose, rather sniffily, that the discipline he teaches is uniquely immune from such findings. There are plenty of scientific minds who would beg to differ.</p> <p>I spoke recently to Professor Carlo Rovelli, groundbreaking theorist of quantum gravity. His book, <em>Seven Brief Lessons of Physics</em>, begins with an account of Albert Einstein, mostly idling and loafing through his teens and early 20s, before his great work began. \u201cYou don\u2019t get anywhere by not \u2018wasting\u2019 time,\u201d Rovelli proposed. I wondered how much he thought that principle essential to scientific practice?</p> <p>\u201cLeaps of knowledge are made when one steps back, and forgets, and explores different things,\u201d he said. In his own life, Rovelli had come to concentrated study in physics only after \u201cbeing a very bad student\u201d travelling, drinking, involving himself in politics, starting a radio station. It is often only through a broad and sociable experience, he argued, that you can find the resolve and opportunity to focus on what Terentjev would call VERY HARD problems. Somewhat sadly, Rovelli suggested, such a life was increasingly impossible in academia.</p> <p>There are plenty of other examples. The one that sticks in my mind is an afternoon I spent at Manchester University with one of the Nobel prize-winning discoverers of graphene, Kostya\u00a0Novoselov. For all the intensive hours of research that led to the discovery of the magical one-atom thick material, the real breakthrough he insisted, with a laugh, had come in a playful after-hours discussion, with a beer or two, and the idea to use a roll of Scotch tape to harvest the material.</p> <p>If Professor Terentjev really believes his own university is different in kind to any other, he could also look a hundred yards up the road. The most significant Cambridge eureka moment of the last century was first announced not in a lab or a journal but in the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804545.stm\" title=\"\">Eagle pub one lunchtime</a>, by Francis Crick and James Watson, both regulars there.</p> <p>All the evidence suggests that, in the healthy brain, recreation makes concentration possible. Is it possible or useful to instruct our minds to be intensely curious about one thing and not about every other thing? The science suggests not.</p>",

But many hold back because they feel that luck rather than ability lies behind their successes, and dread that sooner or later some person or event will expose them for the fraud that deep down they believe themselves to be. Far from being a realistic self-assessment, the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Imposter+Syndrome&amp;oq=Imposter+Syndrome&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1589j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" title=\"\">impostor syndrome</a> mind-trap prevents people from believing in themselves, to the detriment of us all.</p> <p>As a life coach, I work with people who sense they have more personal and professional potential but feel blocked from fulfilling it. For some, hearing about impostor syndrome for the first time is a revelation. They realise that, far from it being their own shameful secret, it is a recognised phenomenon, first identified in 1978 by psychologists <a href=\"http://paulineroseclance.com/impostor_phenomenon.html\" title=\"\">Pauline Clance</a> and <a href=\"http://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf\" title=\"\">Suzanne Imes</a>.</p> <p>According to some estimates, up to <a href=\"https://qz.com/606727/is-imposter-syndrome-a-sign-of-greatness/\" title=\"\">70% of successful people have experienced impostor syndrome</a>, including Maya Angelou, Albert Einstein, and Meryl Streep. Unlike other forms of anxiety that sap confidence, the syndrome\u2019s insidious nature means that external success heightens rather than soothes the effects, as sufferers believe they are only ramping up the confidence trick they are playing on everyone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/social-life-blog/2016/may/04/impostor-syndrome-social-work\">Impostor syndrome in social work: why do we feel like we're not good enough?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am well acquainted with the sleepless nights before a presentation, the chorus of self-criticism even when I do something well, my tendency to explain away success, and the fear of being exposed. Fellow sufferers tend to overwork, people-please, and experience toxic stress and depression. But rather than pushing our anxieties to the back of the emotional inbox and soldier on, I invite us all to lean in. If you spot the symptoms then you have a great opportunity to develop self-awareness, generate pragmatic empathy, and integrate practices that will support you to live a more fulfilled life.</p> <p>First, know that it\u2019s not entirely your fault; evolution is partly responsible. We are all the descendants of worriers. Any strain of homo sapiens who were not would have died out millennia ago. Survival of the fittest means all humans live with degrees of anxiety \u2013 including the kind that can cause impostor syndrome.</p> <p>Second, your culture will also have an effect. As a coach, I have noticed that British clients are less inclined to own success for fear of being labelled arrogant, compared with Americans. Women and people from minority populations also experience impostor syndrome more, due to cultural inequities.</p> <p>Third, as children our emotional need to belong often leads us to downplay our abilities as a survival strategy, believing we are more acceptable when we fit in rather than stand out. This can linger into adulthood where it harms rather than helps us. But while we may not be sole authors of our anxious tendencies, we do have responsibility to do something about it so that we can serve ourselves and the world better.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Have the courage to be imperfect</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next time you fear being exposed as a fraud, name it for what it is \u2013 impostor syndrome. Notice the cascade of bodily sensations and automatic thoughts. Perhaps your stomach flips or heart pounds. What are the scripts that your mind starts running? They will be the same ones again and again, which makes them easier to spot: \u201cI\u2019m useless and people will know\u201d, for instance. Remind yourself that this is not reality, just your perception of it. To name impostor syndrome is to start to sense control over it and recognise that it is a complex condition that you can \u2013 with practise \u2013 overcome.</p> <p>Give each inner script a character so you can recognise who is speaking when they pipe up: \u201cthe judge\u201d or \u201cthe perfectionist\u201d, for instance. They are mechanisms of your subconscious running the same program as when you were a child, working to keep you in your comfort zone where you feel you can manage and be accepted. They often show up when you are taking on more responsibility, challenges and risks.</p> <p>Talk back to them, thank them for services rendered and instruct them that they are surplus to requirements. In parallel, tone up your connection to your inner allies: the inner psychological sub-personalities of your brain\u2019s executive function who encourage and coach you. Name them too: \u201cthe sage\u201d or \u201cthe inner leader\u201d. Though it might feel odd, you are externalising your negative thoughts and tapping into your inner wisdom, clarity, courage and compassion.</p> <p>Have the courage to be imperfect. Our increasing impatience with ourselves seriously depletes our ability to recognise that we are works-in-progress, moving along learning curves all the time. We tend to freeze the frame when we feel nervous, make a mistake or have to sweat to achieve something, and then we damn ourselves for not being up to the job.</p> <p>Finally, take some time to clarify your values. When you know what you stand for, you know what you uniquely have to offer so you won\u2019t pretend you are something you are not, just to get along. Impostor syndrome can be a gift if you use it to create more helpful, mindful, less toxically stressful ways of living. When people share with others who know how they feel, the sense of isolation and shame falls away, and self-awareness, connection and empathy grow. Then we can step forward.</p> <p>\u2022 Fiona Buckland is giving a Guardian Masterclass on 10 October on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2017/jan/20/how-to-tackle-impostor-syndrome\" title=\"\">how to tackle impostor syndrome and embrace your power</a></p>",

When one delegate\u2019s motion in favour of rice pudding with cherry compote was roundly defeated the delegates were left facing a hung vote over the choice of french toast or pancake with apple puree. Another council member then demanded sausages with spaghetti. But a second-round runoff broke the deadlock: 12:4 in favour of pancakes, an absolute majority that everyone could live with.</p> <p>At most nurseries, parents worry that their child will pick up nits, a runny nose or bad language. At the Dolli Einstein Haus in Pinneberg, however, parents hope that their offspring catch a different kind of habit: a taste for democracy.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The nursery, which was certified as Germany\u2019s first \u201cdemocracy nursery\u201d earlier this year, is run on a mission to test how far decision-making processes can be devolved to the under-sixes, by giving children a vote on anything from breakfast menus to nappy changing.</p> <p>Three and a half years into their experiment, the brains behind the project are not only discovering that democratic ideas remain surprisingly contagious even in an era of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/26/populism-is-the-result-of-global-economic-failure\">populist revivals</a>, but that the compromises required are often more challenging for adults than children.<br /></p> <p>Educators at the daycare centre in northern Germany tell the story of six-year-old Pia, who recently objected to her parents telling her to go to sleep by citing the kindergarten\u2019s \u201cconstitution\u201d, which is prominently displayed in each playroom: \u201cI can decide when I go to bed. It\u2019s my right.\u201d</p> <p>The centre\u2019s charter lists seven basic rights: I have the right to sleep; I decide what and how much I eat; I decide what I play with; I decide where I sit; I am allowed to voice my opinion any time; I decide who I want to cuddle with; and I decide who changes my nappies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9f236be0dae236a066b0dc47ed2cbb93495525d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9f236be0dae236a066b0dc47ed2cbb93495525d/0_0_2823_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The kindergarten\u2019s constitution\" width=\"1000\" height=\"826\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kindergarten\u2019s constitution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selim Sudheimer/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the nursery head, Ute Rodenwald, and her deputy, Heike Schl\u00fcter, are quick to reject being bracketed with the non-conformist educational models associated with Germany\u2019s 1968 student movement \u2013 the word \u201canti-authoritarian\u201d elicits howls of denial.</p> <p>\u201cAnti-authoritarian education assumes that any group of children will in mysterious ways learn to regulate and structure itself,\u201d said Schl\u00fcter. \u201cBut since we\u2019ve had our constitution and children have been involved in the decision-making, we have had more rules than before, not fewer.\u201d</p> <p>Children at the Dolli Einstein Haus may get a say on who changes their nappies, but after several amendments the small print of the centre\u2019s founding document makes clear that the right to decide when a nappy needs changing rests exclusively with the educators.</p> <p>Rodenwald sees her project\u2019s mission less in empowering children than equipping them with the skills to cope with with a rapidly changing modern world: \u201cDemocracy is not just about elections. For us it is about people \u2013 or children \u2013 being taken seriously, and learning to make decisions in a way that doesn\u2019t leave other people behind,\u201d she said. </p> <p>As more and more households are made up of two working parents, Rodenwald argues, the pressure has grown on on preschool establishments to take a more active role in educating young people.</p> <p>Originally conceived by a group of educators in the state of Schleswig-Holstein in 2001, the project only truly clicked into gear after Angela Merkel\u2019s first cabinet voted to <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-coalition-agrees-on-radical-expansion-of-nurseries/a-5214290\">triple the number of day care places for children</a> in 2007. Most children at the Dolli Einstein Haus, which is run by the non-profit charity Workers Welfare Institution and named after a talking bird from a children\u2019s book, are registered from age one and stay there from 8am until 4pm on weekdays. </p> <p>Once a week, each group at the nursery meets for a session at which there are two rounds of votes: one on the topping of the afternoon cake, and one on the Friday morning breakfast menu. The former is essentially a referendum, with the educators for example offering a choice between lemon and chocolate cake, while for the latter the children can nominate four meal options.</p> <p>The options are drawn on pieces of paper which are placed in the middle of a circle of children, each of whom sits down on a cushion after listening to the sound of a quiet gong, facing outwards to allow an anonymous vote. When their names are called, the children take turns placing coloured pebbles, known as <em>Muckelsteine</em>, underneath their preferred option.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93eb16d5fc74c95855ce43f69fe767103b6554c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93eb16d5fc74c95855ce43f69fe767103b6554c8/0_201_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl places her vote for cake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl places her vote for cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selim Sudheimer/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In both votes, the result is strictly first past the post and constitutionally binding. The nursery chef has to act out the will of the voters even if it seems disgusting or unhealthy \u2013 a principle which has tested the resolve of parents and educators alike. In the past, the Dolli Einstein Haus has served up pizza and stewed beef with beetroot for breakfast.</p> <p>Rodenwald and her team argue that the onus is on the adults to learn to accept the children\u2019s decisions, rather than the other way around: \u201cIt\u2019s about creating alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201cOur experience is that children will eventually eat spinach, salad or rye bread if you keep on offering it and they see other children eat it.\u201d</p> <p>Bigger decisions, such as investment in new toys or rule changes in the playground, are made at a monthly children\u2019s council attended by pairs of boys and girls nominated as \u201cpassers on\u201d. At one recent such meeting, delegates took their leaders to task after Rodenwald made the unilateral decision to buy a pair of new tricycles.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt was such a good offer and we knew the kids liked tricycles, so I had just gone for it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the children told us in no uncertain terms that we had not been authorised to make that decision. That was one of those moments where we felt: yes, we are on the right path.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if children are the better democrats, but they are certainly less calculating. They don\u2019t say things just in order to please people.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of the potential power struggles these democratically trained toddlers may cause at home, the head of the programme at the Workers Welfare Institution said she was not aware of any parents who had pulled out of a democracy nursery so far.</p> <p>On the contrary: after seven nurseries were certified in February, a further 12 are to follow by the end of the year. By 2020, the charity wants all of its 58 nurseries in Schleswig-Holstein to be run on a democratic basis.</p>",

          "body": "<p>On the internet, advertising is the industry that dare not speak its\u00a0name. A Facebook post is \u201csuggested\u201d; a\u00a0tweet is \u201cpromoted\u201d \u2013 they are ads. An article or video is \u201cpresented by\u201d or \u201csponsored\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s an ad. Even something as impressive as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHtvDA0W34I\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner\u2019s skydive</a> from the edge of space in 2012 \u2013 that was an ad, paid for by Red Bull. The term \u201ccontent\u201d serves to blur lines \u2013 helpfully, from an advertiser\u2019s point of view \u2013 between what is advertising and what isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Google\u2019s founders once wrote that any search engine that sold ads would be compromised; now it\u2019s the biggest advertising company on the planet. Your smartphone, media studies professor Mara Einstein says, is fundamentally an ad-delivery device. Advertising is everywhere. And yet, increasingly, we don\u2019t want to see it. We install ad-blockers because webpages are increasingly slowed down by\u00a0waiting for intrusive adverts to be loaded from some distant server, and because we don\u2019t want to be tracked around the internet by shadowy companies that trade our personal data. But who does ad-blocking really hurt? Clue: not the advertisers.</p> <p>Because ad and marketing people have a twin-barrelled new wheeze, as Einstein explains in illuminating detail. There is \u201ccontent marketing\u201d, in which advertisers produce a \u201cviral\u201d video or whatever that admits, only very subtly, that it\u2019s a piece of advertising, and millions of us perform the valuable labour of \u201csharing\u201d it for them. On the other hand, there is \u201cnative advertising\u201d, where news organisations set up internal departments to create adverts for commercial \u201cpartners\u201d that will be displayed on their own websites, with the minimum possible acknowledgment that this is advertising and not editorial. And so lines become increasingly blurred, as Einstein points out: with content marketing, advertisers become publishers (they produce \u201cfilms\u201d not adverts; and they call their offices \u201cnewsrooms\u201d), while with native advertising, publishers become advertisers. It is an arms race of stealth marketing or what Einstein nicely terms \u201cobscured persuasion\u201d.</p> <p>But so what? You and I, of course, are expert consumers of the media, and we can always tell what is an advert and what isn\u2019t. Or so we think. In fact, studies suggest that even confident, online-savvy millennials can\u2019t, most of the time. \u201cContent confusion\u201d is pandemic. More seriously, and for very good reasons \u2013 those annoyingly slow ads, plus an understandable desire to take what is offered to us for free \u2013 most of us are complicit in ushering in a world where media organisations offering fully independent, fearless editorial may one day\u00a0cease to exist. Publishers have to become stealth advertisers because Google and Facebook are hoovering up all the real ad revenue, and the use of ad-blocking is hurting the rest. The \u201copen\u201d, free business model for new media is plainly a bust. We are going to have to start paying for news, Einstein argues, if we want news to continue existing. In any case, as she points out,\u00a0we pay for it already, just not with money but with our personal data \u2013 which, if we thought about it, we might consider markedly more valuable. \u201cIf we are not willing to pay for content, and if we don\u2019t want to consciously interact with advertising,\u201d she warns, \u201cthen the blurring of church and state is the price we are paying.\u201d</p> <p>Einstein\u2019s explanations of all this \u2013 from internet news organisations to TV product placement and even dating sites \u2013 are thoroughly researched, elegantly explained and often alarming, even for readers familiar with most\u00a0of the above facts in the abstract. Apparently, nearly half of Google users cannot distinguish between the ads and what are wholesomely termed the \u201corganic\u201d results; and shadowy data brokers such as Acxiom can come to learn a remarkable amount of personal facts about ordinary internet users. Profiling may be scandalous when the police do it, but it is all the rage online. In the US, if your name sounds African American, you are 25% more likely to be shown an ad that implies you\u2019ve been arrested in the past.</p> <p>I let out a little silent cheer near the end of this book when Einstein suggested that, instead of pulling out your phone in every idle instant, \u201cmaybe you could just be bored\u201d. Like any good polemic, however, <em>Black Ops Advertising</em> does rather overstate the negative case about today\u2019s internet. Along with many others, for example, I\u2019d rather pay for Netflix than watch \u201cfree\u201d broadcast TV interrupted by adverts, even if Netflix is doing its best to datamine my taste in kung-fu movies and technothrillers in order to design some new show that will doubtless be awesome. And, of course, not every piece of \u201ccontent\u201d that we \u201cshare\u201d online is advertising: you wouldn\u2019t know it from Einstein\u2019s book, but there are still quite a lot of regular people writing and drawing funny things just to amuse their friends.</p> <p>And even \u201cliking\u201d a product page on Facebook is hardly a one-way street if you sincerely admire the brand in question. Sure, as Einstein says, \u201cmarketers want to be friends with us so that we will do the work of sharing their content\u201d, and to do so might be volunteering to perform what in the jargon is known as \u201cunsponsored word of mouth\u201d. But I do, in fact, like Rotring, the German manufacturer of mechanical pencils, as well as the Strokes, and I want to know what they\u2019re up to. For such reasons, and whether we like it not, to be a total online refusenik \u2013 in the way Einstein suggests is the only healthy course of activity \u2013 may, these\u00a0days, be to lead less than a full modern life</p>",

Every time astronomers think they are getting close to understanding the universe, mother nature throws them another curveball to contend with.</p> <p>Today\u2019s googly comes from the <a href=\"http://shsuyu.github.io/H0LiCOW/site/\">H0LiCOW collaboration</a> and takes the form of a faster than expected expansion rate for the universe. Based on new observations taken with the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org\">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, it confirms that a serious discrepancy lies at the heart of our astronomical understanding.</p> <p>The rate at which the universe is expanding is a fundamental quantity with which to test cosmological theory. It is called the Hubble Constant after Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer who first measured it in 1929.</p> <p>Ways to measure Hubble\u2019s constant fall into two camps: the study of relatively nearby celestial objects, and the study of far distant radiation left over from the origin of the universe. </p> <p>Both methods should give the same expansion rate. The trouble \u2013 as confirmed today \u2013 is that they don\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/mar/21/european-space-agency-astronomy\">Planck's 'almost perfect' universe could point to new physics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem was first seen <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-s-hubble-finds-universe-is-expanding-faster-than-expected\">last June</a>, when another team of astronomers known as the <a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/~ariess/Research.htm\">SH0ES project</a>, published a surprisingly high Hubble Constant that conflicted with the value from two spacecraft: NASA\u2019s WMAP and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/mar/21/planck-unveils-earliest-map-of-universe\">ESA\u2019s Planck</a>.<br /></p> <p>WMAP and Planck had calculated relatively slow Hubble Constants from the Universe\u2019s microwave background radiation, which was produced during the split second in which the universe came into existence.<br /></p> <p>At the time, the astronomers were so confident with the spacecraft that they began referring to the era of \u2018precision cosmology\u2019. In their opinion, just about everything was known about the make-up of the universe, with just the astronomical \u2018i\u2019 dotting and \u2019t\u2019 crossing to be done.</p> <p>Today\u2019s results, which are to be published in a series of five papers by the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras\">Royal Astronomical Society</a>, show that there is much more to be done than the fine detail.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ras.org.uk/news-and-press/2946-cosmic-lenses-support-finding-on-faster-than-expected-expansion-of-the-universe\">statement</a> accompanying the results, H0LiCOW team leader Sherry Suyu, <a href=\"https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/\">Technical University Munich</a> Germany said, \u201cThe expansion rate of the Universe is now starting to be measured in different ways with such high precision that actual discrepancies may possibly point towards new physics beyond our current knowledge of the Universe.\u201d</p> <p>The bottom line is that the universe to almost certainly more complex than we thought \u2013 and it\u2019s already byzantine. To explain other puzzling observations, cosmologists have postulated a number of substances that affect the expansion rate.</p> <p>Firstly there is dark energy, which is designed to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Maybe these new observations suggest that it is growing in strength. </p> <p>Secondly, there is dark matter. Despite suspecting its existence for decades now, astronomers and physicists are no closer to detecting a single particle of the stuff. Could it be behaving in a way that affects the expansion?</p> <p>Thirdly, could there be a kind of dark radiation? This would invisibly carry energy around the cosmos, altering the expansion.</p> <p>Fourthly, could there be a problem with Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity? This is the mathematical framework that astronomers use to calculate Hubble\u2019s Constant based on the matter and energy contained in space. If those equations are even slightly off, then we could have everything else right and still be getting the wrong answer.</p> <p>As yet no one knows which is the more likely solution.</p> <p>Today\u2019s results confirm that what started as a niggle has grown into a full-blown problem for cosmology. Put simply, our picture of the universe does not add up and that means there is probably something fundamental we have not yet understood.</p> <p>This is a good thing. The potential for discovery is huge.

          "body": "<p>Most of us know that creativity is not just for artists \u2013 it has always been key to entrepreneurial success. Pushing heretical ideas, having a unique vision, thinking imaginatively and counterintuitively are the very definitions of creativity in business. In a world where a single original idea, like Uber or the Ice Bucket Challenge, can change the world, creative thinking is more valuable than ever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/aug/18/productive-at-work-neuroscientists-advice-multitasking\">Struggling to be productive at work? Take a neuroscientist's advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The big question is how to unlock your own creative potential? Here are a few steps you can take.</p> <h2><strong>Relax and meditate</strong></h2> <p>More brain activity generally means less creativity. Brains exhibiting fast beta waves \u2013 typical of when you\u2019re actively concentrating (such as when you\u2019re at work) \u2013 perform significantly worse on creativity tests than brains exhibiting the slow alpha waves typical of rest or relaxation and even slower theta waves found in meditative states.</p> <p> So to be more creative, ditch the group brainstorming sessions which have been <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1201_1?journalCode=hbas20&amp;\">scientifically proven to be less effective than when people generate ideas alone</a>, partly because of the way such sessions necessarily lead to increased brain activity. Instead, do some yoga or mindful meditation. Listen to nature sounds. Breathe deeply.</p> <h2><strong>Make time for undemanding physical tasks</strong></h2> <p>Creative ideas are unlikely to emerge if your schedule is always busy, goal-directed and involved in conscious, rational problem solving, according to psychologists Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Keith Sawyer. They say in the book The Systems Model of Creativity that creative thinking is \u201cfacilitated by periods of idling, leisure, and involvement in activities such as walking, gardening, driving.\u201d</p> <p> Try putting regular activities of this kind, what I call undemanding physical tasks, into your regular working day. Don\u2019t make it too unchallenging like staring at a wall or too absorbing, like reading an article on your phone. Do something requiring simple bodily coordination and low level mental attention, ideally for five to 10 minutes between two to four times a day. This encourages what\u2019s known as \u201cmind wandering\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22941876\">scientifically known to make creative insights more likely</a>.</p> <p> These tasks shouldn\u2019t be considered a \u201cbreak\u201d from work but as an important part of work. Whether you walk, cycle, knit or casually play the violin (as Einstein did), try forgetting about your pressing work challenges and just do the task. Paradoxically, you may well find that a solution to one or other of your problems just pops into your head. </p> <h2><strong>Practise connecting ideas</strong></h2> <p>How do you make a new idea? Try combining some old ones. Einstein said \u201ccombinatory play seems to be the essential component in productive thought\u201d, while as Steve Jobs put it: \u201cCreativity is just connecting things\u201d. In 1974, for example, Art Fry who worked at the manufacturing firm 3M had the brainwave of combining a weak glue the company had previously developed \u2013 which served no apparent function \u2013 with a bookmark he used in church. The result was the Post-It Note.</p> <p> So try to deliberately blend various ideas, images and concepts together. You\u2019re sitting in a caf\u00e9. See your coffee cup? Combine it with your shoe. What do you get? Footwear infused with a natural odour suppressant (coffee). This kind of playful mental experimentation will enhance your brain\u2019s combinatory faculty and may even produce some usable concepts.</p> <h2><strong>Keep a dream diary</strong></h2> <p>Dreams, with their surreal contradictions, are one of our great untapped creative resources. Paul McCartney wrote the song Yesterday after a dream (he heard the tune in the midst of a dream, awoke and reproduced it). In the 1860s, Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev conceived the concept of the periodic table of elements in a dream, and in the 1840s Elias Howe discovered the secret to the modern sewing machine design while dreaming.</p> <p>We all dream for around two hours every night, yet we forget most of them. Starting a daily dream diary (apps such as DreamSphere and Shadow are also available) will help you recall many more of your dreams, which in itself will make more available to your waking brain a more fluid, imaginative style of thinking. And you never know, you might literally dream up a billion dollar idea.</p> <p><em>Dr Michael Bloomfield is founder and director at <a href=\"http://www.creato-online.com/\">Creato</a>, a creative brain training company.</em></p>",

Actually it was more of a filthy den dug deep in the earth. Goldilocks knocked, but when no one answered, she crawled down into the den.</p> <p>On the table in the den, she found three bowls of porridge.</p> <p>No she didn\u2019t. Bears don\u2019t have the fine motor skills to build tables, nor can they cook. And they don\u2019t like porridge. What Goldilocks actually found was the rotting remains of three dead rabbits.</p> <p>But she was very hungry. So she tried one. It was horrible. She tried another. It was no better. The third rabbit was disgusting, so she ate a cheese sandwich instead.</p> <p>Goldilocks felt sleepy. She lay down in the first bed, which was less a bed than a pile of leaves mixed with mud and bear excrement. The second bed was the same. And the third. But Goldilocks was tired, so she fell fast asleep anyway.</p> <p>As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. They did not say, \u201cSomeone\u2019s been eating my porridge,\u201d or \u201cSomeone\u2019s been sleeping in my bed\u201d, because bears can only speak bear.</p> <p>They did what bears do. They ate her. And they lived happily ever after.</p> <p>There are many people who believe this is the proper way to tell a fairy story. With facts. Because facts are true, and a fact-based education will, according to the British government, be far more useful at helping you to get a job once you\u2019ve graduated from university.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/23/scienceandnature.richarddawkins\" title=\"\"><em>The God Delusion</em></a>, agrees. He announced a few years ago that most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/05/richard-dawkins-fairytales-not-harmful\" title=\"\">fairytales</a> do not stand up to scientific scrutiny. \u201cThere\u2019s a very interesting reason why a princess could not turn into a frog,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s statistically too improbable.\u201d</p> <p>Fairytales are dangerous, Dawkins believes. Parents \u201cshould be fostering in children a spirit of scepticism instead of filling their heads with fantasy\u201d. Children\u2019s imaginations are dangerous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9bfdbd71c14ca7b8a4d8327edb1cf7ef20fde5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9bfdbd71c14ca7b8a4d8327edb1cf7ef20fde5c/0_0_7186_4313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beauty and the Beast: \u2018Without stories we are trapped in a static version of ourselves.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beauty and the Beast: \u2018Without stories we are trapped in a static version of ourselves.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a point upon which Dawkins and the British government agree. In recent years there has been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/artsinschools\" title=\"\">steep decline</a> in the number of pupils taking up the arts \u2013 design, drama, dance, music, painting, sculpture. Study science, economics and maths, the government urges, and pursue a serious career \u2013 such as business, law, banking and finance. A real career, where you can make real money.</p> <p>There is, of course, nothing wrong with studying mathematics and science. But without the arts, that study is wasted. You need imagination to be a great scientist (or a great politician or a\u00a0great lawyer), just as you need it to be a\u00a0great musician or writer. Imagination and the ability to tell a story will make anyone better at anything.</p> <p>As Albert Einstein said: \u201cIf you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales.\u201d Einstein recognised the importance of imagination and storytelling when grappling with the most complex and difficult problems of the universe.</p> <p>Science tells us that 7 billion improbably designed humans live on a ball made of iron, rocks and silicates, floating in a regular ellipse around a hot star in the middle of unimaginable infinite space. And furthermore, these humans have designed Teslas, cricket and waterboarding.</p> <p>Is there a more unlikely story? Most scientific explanations for the workings of the universe are so weird, you\u2019d have to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/douglasadams\" title=\"\">Douglas Adams</a> to think them up. The most popular begins with a huge explosion out of nothingness, from which a vast infinity of objects emerge, moving away from each other for billions of years until one day the whole thing loses momentum and shifts into reverse, collapsing to the size of a raisin.</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>Dawkins thinks the whole idea of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden\u00a0is absurd, but what sane person dreamed up the big bang theory?</p> <p>At the start of every amazing story \u2013 literary or scientific \u2013 is a person with enough imagination to ask a good question. A physicist might ask: \u201cWhat makes up all that empty space in the universe?\u201d A geneticist might ask: \u201cIs there a different way to cure cancer?\u201d A\u00a0science fiction writer might ask: \u201cWhat do creatures in another galaxy look like?\u201d You or I might ask: \u201cWill anyone ever want to have sex with me?\u201d or \u201cHow can I live in a world where Donald Trump is president?\u201d</p> <p>The job of every human is to imagine what one life might achieve, to think about why we live and why we die, why we fall in love with one person and not another; why there\u2019s war, why some people are black and some white, some rich and some poor. Our job is to think about how to live on this planet without destroying it, to reimagine the past and the future of the human race; to examine all the complex, terrifying, hopeful possibilities in history, in politics, in space \u2013 and in the space inside our heads.</p> <p>One of the best ways to start answering questions such as \u201cwho am I?\u201d and \u201cwhat can I do in the world?\u201d is to read\u00a0books.</p> <p>I would say that. I\u2019m a writer. But in my lifetime I\u2019ve lived thousands of lives. I\u2019ve lived on other continents and other planets, been a champion runner, a neurosurgeon, a standup comedian. I\u2019ve survived Auschwitz and a plane crash in the Andes, fought with the East India Company in the 1857 uprising. I\u2019ve bombed Ferrara, crossed the Pacific on a raft, advised Henry VIII not to marry again. I\u2019ve lived inside the head of a man, a horse, a vampire, a gentle Neanderthal. I know what it feels like to be different, to be on the wrong side of history, to be someone other than a middle-class, middle-aged suburban-born American writer who now lives a somewhat ordinary life in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b24b844441317a593b48e6386f068c35039aa01d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b24b844441317a593b48e6386f068c35039aa01d/0_156_2030_1218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sword in the Stone: \u2018Stories give us choices.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sword in the Stone: \u2018Stories give us choices.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 5</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of this I have learned by reading books.</p> <p>Imagine a person who never reads books. Perhaps a person like the president of the United States. What might it do to your brain, never to be anyone other than yourself, in your own here and now? To be a person who knows nothing about how it feels to be a Roman legionary, a Victorian chimney sweep, to be poor, queer, a refugee, a Muslim, a North Korean, a woman, a child, a warrior \u2013 who knows nothing about how it feels to be someone else.</p> <p>Without stories we are trapped in a static version of ourselves.</p> <p>Stories give us choices. In 2013, a 16-year-old girl stood up at a book festival I attended, saying how much she appreciated the way teen novels were helping to change gender and sex stereotypes at her school. There was less bullying, she said, more acceptance of difference. Since 2013, it seems as if our entire understanding of gender and sex has changed \u2013 what was once considered unnatural has become mainstream. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/08/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-transitioning-kardashians-reality-tv-star\" title=\"\">Caitlyn Jenner</a> made celebrity history. Stories told us how it felt.</p> <p>Each of us is writing a life story. Every day we write another chapter. Some sections are page turners, cliffhangers, potboilers. Others drone on endlessly without incident \u2013 the hero will never fall in love, find a career, figure out how to be a person. Each of us is responsible for imagining the best life possible: the funniest, bravest, most meaningful.</p> <p>Most days I wake up thinking that the world is a mess. I worry about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\" title=\"\">climate change</a>, refugees and world war III. I worry about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> and sexual slavery and children dying of starvation.</p> <p>On those days, I think about TH White\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/06/philip-womack-my-inspiration-sword-stone-white\" title=\"\"><em>The Sword in the Stone</em></a>, and Merlin speaking to the young King Arthur. \u201cThe best thing for being sad is\u00a0to learn something,\u201d says Merlin. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that never fails.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned to write my own fairytales. In my fairytale, the bears don\u2019t eat Goldilocks. She and the baby bear fall in love. They run off together, grow up, have their own baby. The baby is half-human, half-bear; brave and strong and fierce. They call her Celeste, and she grows up to be president of the United Nations of Earth. She governs wisely over a happy and peaceful world for generations to come.</p> <p>That\u2019s my fairytale. Now write yours.</p> <p>This is an edited version of a speech given at the Berlin literature festival.</p>",

The child that takes maths GCSE while still in single figures, or a rarity such as Ruth Lawrence, who was admitted to Oxford while her contemporaries were still in primary school.</p> <p>But look closer and a different story emerges. Mirzakhani was born in Tehran, one of three siblings in a middle-class family whose father was an engineer. The only part of her childhood that was out of the ordinary was the Iran-Iraq war, which made life hard for the family in her early years. Thankfully it ended around the time she went to secondary school.</p> <p>Mirzakhani, did go to a highly selective girls\u2019 school but maths wasn\u2019t her interest \u2013 reading was. She loved novels and would read anything she could lay her hands on; together with her best friend she would prowl the book stores on the way home from school for works to buy and consume.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/audio/2010/may/31/science-weekly-live-podcast-genius\">The Guardian's Science Weekly podcast: What makes a genius?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for maths, she did rather poorly at it for the first couple of years in her middle school, but became interested when her elder brother told her about what he\u2019d learned. He shared a famous maths problem from a magazine that fascinated her \u2013 and she was hooked. The rest is mathematical history.</p> <p>Is her background unusual? Apparently not. Most Nobel laureates were unexceptional in childhood. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Einstein</a> was slow to talk and was dubbed the dopey one by the family maid. He failed the general part of the entry test to Zurich Polytechnic \u2013 though they let him in because of high physics and maths scores. He struggled at work initially, failing to get academic post and being passed over for promotion at the Swiss Patent Office because he wasn\u2019t good enough at machine technology. But he kept plugging away and eventually rewrote the laws of Newtonian mechanics with his theory of relativity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lifecourse.web.unc.edu/research_projects/terman/\">Lewis Terman</a>, a pioneering American educational psychologist, set up a study in 1921 following 1,470 Californians, who excelled in the newly available IQ tests, throughout their lives. None ended up as the great thinkers of their age that Terman expected they would. But he did miss two future Nobel prize winners \u2013 Luis Alvarez and William Shockley, both physicists \u2013 whom he dismissed from the study as their test scores were not high enough.</p> <p>There is a canon of research on high performance, built over the last century, that suggests it goes way beyond tested intelligence. On top of that, research is clear that brains are malleable, new neural pathways can be forged, and IQ isn\u2019t fixed. Just because you can read Harry Potter at five doesn\u2019t mean you will still be ahead of your contemporaries in your teens.</p> <p>According to my colleague, Prof Deborah Eyre, with whom I\u2019ve collaborated on the book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/great-minds-and-how-to-grow-them.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Great Minds and How to Grow Them</a>, the latest neuroscience and psychological research suggests most people, unless they are cognitively impaired, can reach standards of performance associated in school with the gifted and talented. However, they must be taught the right attitudes and approaches to their learning and develop the attributes of high performers \u2013 curiosity, persistence and hard work, for example \u2013 an approach Eyre calls \u201chigh performance learning\u201d. Critically, they need the right support in developing those approaches at home as well as at school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97cca712ae6cc10002dc4668bf6e20acc3d0fd93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97cca712ae6cc10002dc4668bf6e20acc3d0fd93/374_0_5626_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maryam Mirzakhani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maryam Mirzakhani won the Fields Medal, the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel prize, but showed little maths ability to begin with.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clay Mathematics Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, is there even such a thing as a gifted child? It is a highly contested area. Prof Anders Ericsson, an eminent education psychologist at Florida State University, is the co-author of Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise. After research going back to 1980 into diverse achievements, from music to memory to sport, he doesn\u2019t think unique and innate talents are at the heart of performance. Deliberate practice, that stretches you every step of the way, and around 10,000 hours of it, is what produces the expert. It\u2019s not a magic number \u2013 the highest performers move on to doing a whole lot more, of course, and, like Mirzakhani, often find their own unique perspective along the way.</p> <p>Ericsson\u2019s memory research is particularly interesting because random students, trained in memory techniques for the study, went on to outperform others thought to have innately superior memories \u2013 those you might call gifted.</p> <p>He got into the idea of researching the effects of deliberate practice because of an incident at school, in which he was beaten at chess by someone who used to lose to him. His opponent had clearly practised.</p> <p>But it is perhaps the work of Benjamin Bloom, another distinguished American educationist working in the 1980s, that gives the most pause for thought and underscores the idea that family is intrinsically important to the concept of high performance.</p> <p>Bloom\u2019s team looked at a group of extraordinarily high achieving people in disciplines as varied as ballet, swimming, piano, tennis, maths, sculpture and neurology, and interviewed not only the individuals but their parents, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/how-to-raise-a-brilliant-child-without-screwing-them-up\">How to raise a brilliant child without screwing them up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He found a pattern of parents encouraging and supporting their children, in particular in areas they enjoyed themselves. Bloom\u2019s outstanding adults had worked very hard and consistently at something they had become hooked on young, and their parents all emerged as having strong work ethics themselves.</p> <p>While the jury is out on giftedness being innate and other factors potentially making the difference, what is certain is that the behaviours associated with high levels of performance are replicable and most can be taught \u2013 even traits such as curiosity.</p> <p>Eyre says we know how high performers learn. From that she has developed a high performing learning approach that brings together in one package what she calls the advanced cognitive characteristics, and the values, attitudes and attributes of high performance. She is working on the package with a group of pioneer schools, both in Britain and abroad.</p> <p>But the system needs to be adopted by families, too, to ensure widespread success across classes and cultures. Research in Britain shows the difference parents make if they take part in simple activities pre-school in the home, supporting reading for example. That support shows through years later in better A-level results, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/research/featured-research/effective-pre-school-primary-secondary-education-project\">Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary study</a>, conducted over 15 years by a team from Oxford and London universities.</p> <p>Eye-opening spin-off research, which looked in detail at 24 of the 3,000 individuals being studied who were succeeding against the odds, found something remarkable about what was going in at home. Half were on free school meals because of poverty, more than half were living with a single parent, and four in five were living in deprived areas.</p> <p>The interviews uncovered strong evidence of an adult or adults in the child\u2019s life who valued and supported education, either in the immediate or extended family or in the child\u2019s wider community. Children talked about the need to work hard at school and to listen in class and keep trying. They referenced key adults who had encouraged those attitudes.</p> <p>Einstein, the epitome of a genius, clearly had curiosity, character and determination. He struggled against rejection in early life but was undeterred. Did he think he was a genius or even gifted? No. He once wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m so smart, it\u2019s just that I stay with problems longer. Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character.\u201d</p> <p>And what about Mirzakhani? Her published quotations show someone who was curious and excited by what she did and resilient. One comment sums it up. \u201cOf course, the most rewarding part is the \u2018Aha\u2019 moment, the excitement of discovery and enjoyment of understanding something new \u2013 the feeling of being on top of a hill and having a clear view. But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being on a long hike with no trail and no end in sight.\u201d</p> <p>The trail took her to the heights of original research into mathematics in a cruelly short life. That sounds like unassailable character. Perhaps that was her gift.</p> <p><em>Great Minds and How to Grow Them, by Wendy Berliner &amp; Deborah Eyre.

The <a href=\"http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/100\">paper</a> which swung the scientific consensus in favour of the existence of photons was published by Albert Einstein in 1905, and yet in 1951 he wrote to an old friend</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These fifty years of conscious brooding have not brought me any closer to an answer to the question: \u201cWhat are light quanta?\u201d Today the first rascal believes he knows what they are, but he deludes himself.

When things break up like that in a particle collision, we call it \u201cinelastic\u201d scattering.</p> <p>A much more elusive process is the elastic scattering of photons; light bouncing off light, and nothing else being produced. The term \u201celastic\u201d is used because, as when bouncing a rubber ball, the amount of kinetic energy \u2013 the energy of motion of the ball \u2013 is conserved. The ball bounces back pretty much as hard as you throw it. (In an inelastic collision some of this energy is distributed amongst the new particles, or lost as heat, or otherwise converted into a different form.)</p> <p>The first strong evidence for the elastic scattering of photons at high energies has just been <a href=\"http://atlas.cern/updates/press-statement\">reported</a> by the ATLAS experiment (which I work on) at the Large Hadron Collider. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nphys4208.html\">measurement</a> of this process is made during the periods when the LHC is smashing lead nuclei together, rather than in its usual proton-smashing mode. Because the lead nucleus has a charge 82 times that of the proton, and because electric charge is a source of photons, there is a dense cloud of high-energy photons accompanying the bunches\u00b9 of nuclei. Sometimes nuclei hit each other, sometimes they hit photons, and sometimes \u2013 more rarely \u2013 photons hit each other and bounce off elastically.</p> <p>The analysis involves identifying photons in the ATLAS detector in collision events which are otherwise very quiet. The picture at the top of the article shows a representation of the real data from once such collision. The beams come from behind and in front of the picture and collide in the centre of the blue and purple circles. Those circles are the charged-particle detectors of ATLAS, showing almost no activity, because photons carry no electric charge. The green and yellow wedges show the energy deposited by the scattered photons in the calorimeter \u2013 the part of ATLAS responsible for energy measurement. A more usual lead-lead collision would be a bit busier, something like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"803d5cdb7130858cddd2d7de98f7176e0578a3a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/803d5cdb7130858cddd2d7de98f7176e0578a3a5/0_265_2365_1419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the first higher energy (13 TeV) heavy ion collisions recorded by the ALICE detector, on 25 November 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the first higher energy (13 TeV) heavy ion collisions recorded by the ALICE detector, on 25 November 2015</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ALICE/CERN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elastic light-light scattering is an intrinsically quantum-mechanical process.

          "body": "<p>The Cambridge polymath William Whewell wrote in 1837 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/isaac-newton\" title=\"\">Isaac Newton</a>\u2019s introduction of a universal law of gravity a century and a half earlier was \u201cindisputably and incomparably the greatest scientific discovery ever made\u201d. The judgment still looks sound. Gravity continues to make headlines, as we saw last year when astronomers first directly observed gravity waves, predicted a century before by Albert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\" title=\"\">Einstein</a> using his theory of gravity. This was not revolutionary theory, he often said, but simply a rational development of the Newtonian framework it superseded.</p> <p>In <em>The Ascent of Gravity</em>, the science writer and former astrophysicist Marcus Chown traces our understanding of gravity from Newton\u2019s pioneering ideas to the present state of well-informed perplexity. Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity has passed every observational test with flying colours but no one has succeeded in making it consistent with\u00a0the other great theory of modern physics, quantum mechanics, which accurately describes the world on the smallest scale. Although physicists have made impressive progress towards a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists\" title=\"\">quantum theory of gravity</a>, the subject is in a bit of a mess.</p> <p>Chown begins by describing how Newton gave the first mathematically precise account of gravity in his <em>Principia</em>. Central to it was his unifying insight that the type of force pulling an apple vertically downwards is the same as the force holding celestial objects in their orbits around the sun. The theory\u00a0was a triumph, offering a clear understanding of tides, an elegant explanation of the puzzling regularities in planetary orbits and predictions of the paths of other celestial objects. As\u00a0Chown says: \u201cThe law of universal gravity is a gift that keeps on giving.\u201d</p> <p>In Newton\u2019s view, a mathematical description of God\u2019s universe, consistent with all observations, was the best that could be achieved. But many of his peers on the continent strongly disagreed. The theory must explain why gravity exists, they argued, not just apply ingenious mathematics to it. As one influential reviewer in France put it, Newton \u201chas not considered [the] principles as a physicist, but as a mere mathematician\u201d. Although there was no doubting his theory of gravity\u2019s success in accounting for observations, Newton was never able to demonstrate that his theory could account for the stability of\u00a0the solar system and for some fine details of the moon\u2019s motion. When he\u00a0was 70 he gave up trying: \u201cI\u00a0am satisfied that it will never be perfected but by somebody who understands the theory of gravity as well or better than I do.\u201d</p> <p>It was the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace and his associates who first demonstrated that Newton\u2019s universal law of gravity accounts fully for the motion of celestial objects and the solar system\u2019s stability. Between 1799 and 1825, Laplace presented it in <em>Celestial Mechanics</em>, his masterpiece of\u00a0gravity theory published in five volumes, one of them dedicated to his benefactor, Napoleon. Chown surprisingly makes no mention of his work or the impact it had on science. Inspired by the success of Newton\u2019s account of gravity, Laplace and his school strove to understand other basic forces of nature all with the same mathematical form as the law of gravity. Thus began the modern discipline of physics, essentially a French invention.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chown sets out the key ideas clearly without recourse to jargon and intimi\u00addating mathematics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chown does Einstein proud in demonstrating the origins and consequences of his new theory of gravity, aptly described by the physicist Max Born as\u00a0\u201cthe most amazing combination of philosophical penetration, physical intuition and mathematical skill\u201d. Einstein was motivated not only by tiny disagreements between observations and Newton\u2019s theory, Chown explains, but also because the theory was not consistent with the basic theory of relativity. Soon after Einstein learned the correct mathematical approach, he understood that the concept of the force of gravity needed to be replaced by the local curvature of space-time. It took him eight years to complete the theory, which he finalised in the nick of time, in November 1915, just pipping the mathematician David Hilbert to the post.</p> <p>Chown is good company. He tells his story clearly and sets out the key ideas without recourse to jargon and intimidating mathematics. As he makes plain, Einstein had come up with another theory of gravity that was profoundly revealing. Its fundamental equation, which can be written on the palm of a human hand, contains a wealth of insights about nature, including predictions not only of gravitational waves but of exotic new objects such as black holes and wormholes. Furthermore, as Einstein showed, it gives the theoretical basis of modern cosmology.</p> <p>Much of <em>The Ascent of Gravity</em> covers well-trodden ground, but in the final part Chown takes us into less familiar territory, exploring current research into quantum theories of gravity. The most popular of them \u2013 based on the idea that most fundamental entities of\u00a0nature are tiny, vibrating pieces of\u00a0string\u00a0\u2013 gave the first serviceable explanation of why gravity exists: it\u00a0emerges unavoidably from the mathematics. Although experts have made advances in string theory, they have not yet been able to use it to make any predictions that experimenters can check, fuelling scepticism about the basic approach.</p> <p>But today\u2019s leading gravity theorists are not downcast. To find out where they believe their subject is heading, Chown has talked with several experts, including the Canadian <a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/scholars/arkani-hamed\" title=\"\">Nima Arkani-Hamed</a>, a highly regarded theoretician based at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton. Arkani-Hamed is optimistic that quantum theory and the basic theory of relativity are together leading us to a quantum theory of gravity and of the other fundamental forces of nature. He says experts are \u201cpretty universally agreed\u201d that their current best understanding of space and time is \u201cdoomed\u201d.</p> <p>To establish a completely satisfactory quantum theory of gravity may well take another indisputably and incomparably great discovery, which is why so many talented young physicists risk going into this extremely challenging field. \u201cThere has never been a better time to study gravity,\u201d Arkani-Hamed insists, and Chown\u2019s eminently readable book helps us understand why.</p> <p>\u2022 Graham Farmelo is the author of <em>Churchill\u2019s Bomb </em>(Faber). <em>The Ascent of Gravity</em> is published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson.

It\u2019s like I\u2019m a massive, 10-tonne boulder rolling down the hill.\u201d</p> <p>Dyslexia causes reading and spelling challenges, but positivity about the condition is a growing part of the campaign to improve awareness and coping strategies. The British Dyslexia Association is exploring the theme during the annual <a href=\"http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/fundraising/dyslexia-awareness-week\">Dyslexia Awareness Week</a> next month, with events in schools and the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/positivedyslexia2017?src=hash\">#positivedyslexia2017</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI have five severely dyslexic children,\u201d says the association\u2019s policy manager Sue Flohr, who is herself dyslexic. \u201cThey\u2019re now a doctor, a teacher, a photographer, a designer and a nightclub manager. Dyslexia doesn\u2019t prohibit anything, and being positive about it encourages children to find their strengths while working around weaknesses.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c51374892082972844f08e413299ebe6c0dc3139\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c51374892082972844f08e413299ebe6c0dc3139/130_0_1907_2382/801.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Einstein\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Einstein: the theoretical physicist didn\u2019t let his dyslexia stop him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doreen Spooner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/illustrated-guide-to-dyslexia-and-its-amazing-people.html\">The Illustrated Guide to Dyslexia and Its Amazing People</a>, published later this month, is written by two dyslexic mothers of dyslexic children. After a foreword by the dyslexic architect Richard Rogers, it offers practical solutions to particular challenges while also celebrating dyslexia\u2019s advantages. \u201cSchool can still be demoralising, but when you hear about people doing superbly well in all kinds of careers, it really helps,\u201d says co-author Kate Power.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-advantages-of-dyslexia/\">Research</a> into possible differences in the wiring of the brain is ongoing, but tests routinely show that dyslexics are better at spatial reasoning and \u201cseeing the bigger picture\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to do what I do if I wasn\u2019t dyslexic,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.jimrokos.com/\">Jim Rokos</a>, a product designer and the curator of <a href=\"https://thedesignjunction.co.uk/london/dyslexic-design/\">Dyslexic Design</a>, an exhibition that was mounted in London last year. \u201cI can play with shapes and do experiments in my head in a way that other designers might not be able to.\u201d</p> <p>Rokos also believes that, if nothing else, the expectation of failure many dyslexics learn at school means they are more willing to take a risk and try new things (you are expected to fail, so why not?). But otherwise, he adds, \u201cIf you were to design a system to remove a person\u2019s self confidence, you\u2019d come up with schools. So, for someone such as Jamie Oliver to say this really helps give some hope so that kids can get through to adulthood.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>Isaac Newton set it up for Albert Einstein: he calculated a system of heavenly motion that governed the entire measurable cosmos. He then added a challenge: a theory, he wrote \u201cthat agrees exactly with exact astronomical observations cannot fail to be true.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He didn\u2019t live to find out quite how much frustration that claim would give his fellow astronomers, who identified Uranus, and then from the behaviour of Uranus inferred the existence of another planet, and finally identified Neptune. They relied on Newton\u2019s predictions, which were spot on and self-evidently right, all the way to the edge of the solar system - except for one tiny little niggling detail about the planet closest to the sun. </p> <p>Mercury\u2019s orbit precesses around the sun at a rate that cannot be fully accounted for by Newtonian mechanics. The discrepancy is very small, but it isn\u2019t an observational error. And since Newton\u2019s theory could hardly be wrong, the only answer that made sense was that there must be another small, invisible companion affecting the orbit of Mercury. So sure were astronomers that this companion planet must exist, they even gave it a name: Vulcan.</p> <p>Vulcan remained a notional member of the solar system right up to November 1915, when Albert Einstein unfurled a theory of general relativity that provided a different and more successful explanation of the phenomenon of gravitational attraction. The Hunt for Vulcan is an object lesson in how science is done, why scientists sometimes get things wrong, and ultimately, why they get things right. </p> <p>Thomas Levenson\u2019s book is one of six finalists in the Royal Society Insight Investment Science Book prize. It is already a winner, in the sense that each of the runners up gets a \u00a32,500 award. But the overall \u00a325,000 winner is to be announced on 19 September by a team of judges led by the author Bill Bryson, himself a Science Book prize winner in 2004. </p> <p>The other candidates, all previously reviewed in the Guardian, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/17/most-perfect-thing-inside-birds-egg-tim-birkhead-review-alex-preston\">The Most Perfect Thing</a>, by Tim Birkhead (Bloomsbury);  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/05/cure-a-journey-into-the-science-of-mind-over-body-by-jo-marchant-review\">Cure</a>, by Jo Marchant (Canongate);</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/02/atomsphere-hope-tim-flannery-planet-remade-oliver-morton-review\">The Planet Remade</a>, by Oliver Morton; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/06/the-gene-an-intimate-history-siddhartha-mukherjee-review\">The Gene</a>, by Siddhartha Mukherjee (Bodley Head) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/13/the-invention-of-nature-the-adventures-of-alexander-von-humboldt-andrea-wulf-review\">The Invention of Nature</a>, by Andrea Wulf (John Murray).</p> <p>Some science books explore new science, or neglected science, or enduring puzzles, or forgotten adventures in science. Levenson\u2019s is a fresh, smartly-paced account of a story much of which has already been told in different forms many times and especially last year, on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/25/video-100-years-of-einsteins-general-relativity\"> hundredth birthday of Einstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity</a>. </p> <p>Don\u2019t discount it for that. By making Vulcan the star turn, so to speak, Levenson shines a light on how science really happens. Other histories of planetary discovery speed past the mistakes and get to the great achievements. Levenson follows the twists and turns of the Vulcan pursuit \u2013 including the newspaper reports, the academic bickering and frustration \u2013 and with a light touch delivers serious lessons. One of them, which should be a comfort to us all, is that scientists keep on testing their own assumptions, and questioning their own observations. Yes, if they expect to find something, there is a likelihood that they will see what they are looking for, but they don\u2019t like to be the only people to see it. The lesson is that good science is replicable. </p> <p>The other is that good scientists worry about tiny details: it\u2019s not enough to be broadly right. If you can\u2019t be dead right then something must be wrong. </p> <p>So if Newton was consistently right then there must be another explanation for an anomaly in Mercury\u2019s orbit: if the missing planet or asteroid hadn\u2019t already been seen it must be masked by the sun, in which case it ought to be visible during solar eclipse.</p> <p>The now-you-see-it, now-you-don\u2019t story of Vulcan provides a lot of the fun in Levenson\u2019s text, and at the same time introduces unexpected characters (among them Thomas Alva Edison) in a comedy of errors that lasted from 1859 to 1915, or possibly to 1919, when Sir Arthur Eddington observed an eclipse and claimed confirmation of Einstein\u2019s predictions (and I am especially grateful for the New York Times headline coverage: \u201cLIGHTS ALL ASKEW IN THE HEAVENS. Men of Science More or Less Agog Over Results of Eclipse Observations.\u201d)</p> <p>New readers who want to learn how the solar system works could profit from this book. Those who think they already know the story of the revolution in astronomy from Newton to Einstein will find episodes new to them. And those looking for a moral will find one nicely phrased: \u201cScience is unique among human ways of knowing because it is self-correcting,\u201d writes Levenson. \u201cEvery claim is provisional.\u201d </p> <ul> <li>To order The Hunt for Vulcan: how Albert Einstein Destroyed a Planet and Deciphered the Universe for \u00a36.55 (Head of Zeus, RRP\u00a37.99) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hunt-for-vulcan-425142.html\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

          "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blog, and our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/sep/18/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos from last week</a>.</p> <p>A good book can hit you hard \u2013 <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16060838\">Tom Mooney</a> says that Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Olive Kitteridge has left him \u201cstricken\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has placed the huge weight of life on my shoulders, of what is left to face, of everything that can and will go wrong, the complications of family and parenthood. Jesus, I need a lie down.</p> <p>Anyway, what a superb book. Exquisitely written, full of real, believable characters, funny and desperately sad. I wouldn\u2019t have picked this up if my wife hadn\u2019t shoved it at me, probably because it sounds and looks a little feminine, but I\u2019m so glad she did because I have discovered another new author.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the subject of books that might easily have been missed, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4515468\">vermontlogger </a>feels lucky to have picked up Einstein: His Life And Universe by Walter Isaacson:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I knew nothing about it until I chanced on it at a book sale and started dipping in. Apparently it was a number one bestseller, and you can see why. The writing is magnificently fluent and attractive. Some of the passages dealing with the great man\u2019s early life do seem a bit dutiful but the author really lets his excitement show when he gets into explaining the papers on the Special and General Theories. He takes you step by step through the process that allowed Einstein to arrive at his \u201chead-snapping\u201d insights (all by deduction from newly postulated first principles and none by induction from the experimental data) in such a clear way that even a non-scientist like me can hold it in his brain for a fleeting second. One cosmological implication Einstein drew was that three-dimensional space can curve back on itself to create a system that is simultaneously finite and unbounded. How cool is that!</p> </blockquote> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15111626\">TheLittlestRascal</a> missed The Blade Itself first time around:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For some reason, couldn\u2019t get past the first hundred of pages a few years back, but figured it deserved one more chance.</p> <p>This brick of a book sets the scene for the following novels of the trilogy and introduces most of the key players, which include barbarians, noblemen, inquisitors, and magi. And by the time I finished the chapter aptly titled \u201cA Road Between Two Dentists\u201d I had already developed some strong feelings for the inquisitor. Well, of course I just had to. </p> <p>It feels like our postmodern world deserves its own postmodern fantasy, and <em>The Blade Itself </em>seems to be one of those: lots of allusions to Discworld and pop-culture references to be picked up along the way. A fight of two rugged barbarians reminds of some classic spaghetti western, and preparation for a fencing contest resembles the best bits of Rocky. Not sure how much of that was intended, but it definitely felt good to stumble upon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Revisiting a book has also been profitable for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3349583\">Glozboy</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m currently re-reading Stephen King\u2019s It, 16 years after I first read it as a teenager. I remembered it being consistently scary and some of the scenes have never left me.</p> <p>So far I\u2019m 400 pages in and it hasn\u2019t let up. An absolute masterpiece.</p> <p>This is one of those books that I never want to see the film/TV series of as it would destroy my mental image, <em>The Stand</em> being another one.</p> </blockquote> <p>Zola\u2019s Germinal has also been worth rereading for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is the novel, way back, that had me fall in love with Zola, and I have to say it still doesn\u2019t disappoint. This brutal tale of life on the northern French coalfields in the 1860s during a long strike is stunning. From Zola\u2019s depiction of the everyday life of coalminers, the clash between Capital and Labour, Socialism and Anarchism at the time of the First International, and Zola\u2019s great narrative of the course of the destructive strike, this is a sweeping portrait of some of the worst of 19th Century industrial life. Undoubtedly it is one of the greatest Victorian novels.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, it\u2019s almost Halloween, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s get in the mood with <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15548189\">elliese</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I so love Victorian (and older) ghost stories. The best ones are exquisitely crafted, and you hover between admiration of the writer\u2019s sheer skill and the pure terror of the tale itself. The only stumbling-block is the occasional story that hinges on the protagonist acting in a manner that\u2019s frankly incomprehensible to modern sensibilities; poor Aubrey in Polidori\u2019s The Vampyre is such a relentlessly moronic goop it\u2019s hard to feel very sorry for him, and so is Ernest in The Bride of Lindorf. (What a <em>plonker</em>.) But I really loved most of the other stories in the Oxford University Press anthology The Vampyre and other Tales of the Macabre. It was fascinating to see the themes and anxieties of live burial and grave robbing come out in the stories again and again. Alan Cunningham\u2019s The Master of Logan had an atmosphere and themes that reminded me of Stevenson, and Catherine Gore\u2019s The Red Man was terrifying.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li>A growing list of <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/apersonalanthology\">fantasy anthologies of short fiction</a>.</li> <li>On the <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/09/21/human-life-is-punishment-on-the-pleasures-of-studying-latin/#more-115752\">delights of learning Latin</a>.</li> <li>Rod Mengham <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2017/09/06/rod-mengham/the-eighth-hill-of-rome/?utm_source=LRB+blog+email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20170919+blog&amp;utm_content=ukrw_nonsubs\">writes about the eighth hill of Rome in the London Review of Books</a>.</li> <li><a href=\"http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/event/david-lynch-week-club-silencio/\">A tiny list</a>, but still fascinating for the David Lynch fans among us (although you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the genius director likes Franz Kafka.)</li> </ul> <p>If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

Not much, apart from all being part of a new boom of graphic biographies.</p> <p>Using comics to tell life stories is an established art: think Maus, Art Spiegelman\u2019s investigation of his family\u2019s ordeal during the Holocaust; or Marjane Satrapi\u2019s Persepolis, her memoir of an Iranian childhood. More recently, the March trilogy by US congressman and civil rights hero John Lewis, with Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell, was sent shooting up bestseller charts after a spat between Lewis and US president Donald Trump.</p> <p>But while superheroes, science fiction and horror still comprise the majority of the comic book market, a flood of deeply researched graphic biographies have recently been published. Some subjects \u2013 Vincent Van Gogh, Albert Einstein, Gandhi, Sigmund Freud \u2013 are well-known; others less so, such as novelist and folklorist <a href=\"https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/blog/2017/03/fire-zora-neale-hurston-story\">Zora Neale Hurston in Fire!!</a>, or 19th-century ornithologist John James Audubon, in the sumptuously illustrated <a href=\"http://nobrow.net/shop/audubon-on-the-wings-of-the-world/\">On The Wings of the World</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58a80ff06cbb25ed54bf9362bbee52bad1053826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58a80ff06cbb25ed54bf9362bbee52bad1053826/0_0_1725_2370/728.jpg\" alt=\"Fire!!

With a biography there are a lot of people going to be questioning you and what you create about a person.\u201d</p> <p>Bagge starts by reading traditional biographies of his subjects, then boils down their lives into a series of key moments. In his biography of Hurston, Bagge pinpointed moments such as when the magazine Opportunity \u2013 \u201cThe Journal of Negro Life\u201d \u2013 accepted her first short story in 1924, and or when she moved to Harlem on the advice of the editor. Bagge writes all of this into a script he later uses uses to draw from. Without pages and pages of exposition, comics can boil a life down to the bare essentials by marrying art and text \u2013 Hurston\u2019s being accepted for publication and moving to New York is told in a single page.</p> <p>Bagge\u2019s first full-length graphic biography was <a href=\"https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/woman-rebel\">Woman Rebel</a>, about activist and birth control campaigner Margaret Sanger. \u201cI don\u2019t set out to cover the entire lives of the people I write about,\u201d he says. \u201cWith both Sanger and Hurston, their lives were very busy and interesting right up to the end, so it\u2019s a case of making that work in comic form.\u201d</p> <p>The whole process takes around three years per book \u2013 but it\u2019s a long haul that Bagge enjoys. He is currently at work on a biography of Rose Wilder Lane, the writer and journalist daughter of Little House on the Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder. \u201cReality beats the made-up stuff,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The compact form does not mean there is any less research, say Anne Simon and Corinne Maier, who created bestselling biographies of Karl Marx, Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. Like Bagge, artist Simon researches to \u201cfind \u2018my\u2019 Freud, \u2018my\u2019 Marx, \u2018my\u2019 Einstein\u201d, while writer Maier reads extensively about her subject before starting. While she knew the life and work of Freud, and understood Marxism, she says she knew nothing about Einstein. \u201cI was very surprised to learn that he was a womaniser!\u201d she says. \u201cI could not imagine him in bed with a woman \u2026 but seriously, I immersed myself in relativity, I sweated blood and water to try to understand it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7560b118e2d5219133207e498a69ecd71ccbda7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7560b118e2d5219133207e498a69ecd71ccbda7/0_0_600_791/379.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein graphic novel biography\" width=\"379\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maier explains Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity in a page.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nobrow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The popularity of comic-book biographies has seen subjects who might not get attention from a prose publisher immortalised on the page. These include Somali runner and refugee Samia Yusuf Omar, featured in An Olympic Dream by Reinhard Kleist; or The Boxer, from the same author, about Holocaust survivor Harry Haft; and adventurous journalist William Seabrook, in Joe Ollmann\u2019s The Abominable Mr Seabrook.</p> <p>This shift may strike the cynically minded as a turn for the horribly stupid, like the apocryphal tales of students using <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/books/rarebooks/comics-moby-dick-albert-kanter-three-muskateers/classics-illustrated.shtml\">Classic Illustrated comic books </a>like Moby-Dick to do their English literature homework, instead of, say, the actual Moby-Dick. But aren\u2019t comic-book biographies, due to their layout, unavoidably less detailed than their traditional counterparts?</p> <p>Not at all, says Sam Humphrey, of British comics publisher SelfMadeHero, who praises comic-book biographies as being part of a sophisticated shift away from superheroes: \u201c[They] are often concise, accessible, even breezy, but they rarely lack the weight of research. The kind of scene-setting that might require 20 pages of prose can be accomplished in a couple pages of artwork; a single splash page can conjure the sights, sounds and smells of a particular place at a particular time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they can be read in a day or two \u2013 that\u2019s an obvious benefit.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>We all travel in time mentally when we think about the past or the future, and I for one close my eyes every night and travel instantaneously into tomorrow. But the idea of some kind of technology that allows us to literally transport ourselves to a different era is surprisingly recent. James Gleick\u2019s historical survey of the concept concludes that, apart from a couple of vague anticipations in the 19th century, the idea really was invented in 1895, in HG Wells\u2019s novel <em>The Time Machine</em>.</p> <p>Cue more than a century of literary, philosophical and scientific investigations into the topic. There are logical knots aplenty, as when people travel back in time to kill their ancestors (the Grandfather Paradox). There are alt-history fantasies of killing Hitler. There is a flux capacitor powering a DeLorean time machine; there is a Time Lord zooming around in an old police phone box; and there is the head-spinning set of nested time loops in Shane Carruth\u2019s extraordinary micro-budget first film, <em>Primer</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/11/doctor-who-why-we-are-all-time-travellers-now\">Do we still need Doctor Who? Time travel in the internet age</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last example is not mentioned in this book, but a lot else is, including more metaphorical forms of time travel: there is a fascinating, wry chapter, for example, on the craze for burying cultural objects inside \u201ctime capsules\u201d in the hope that our descendants won\u2019t think we were all complete idiots. (The time capsule, Gleick writes, is \u201ca tragi-comic time machine. It lacks an engine, goes nowhere, sits and waits.\u201d) From Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s story \u201cThe Garden of Forking Paths\u201d to TS Eliot, entropy and free will, the book is rich with associative detail.</p> <p>At first, time travel seemed a harmless fantasy, until Kurt G\u00f6del showed Albert Einstein that his equations of relativity allowed solutions in which time travel appeared to be possible, although no one yet knows exactly how. Mathematicians and physicists got to work, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet. The best argument against the possibility of time travel is probably that supplied by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/hawking\">Stephen Hawking</a>, who has pointed out that we are not invaded by hordes of tourists from the future. (Hawking posits that somehow metaphysically embedded within the universe is a \u201cChronology Protection Principle\u201d.) But that is not a knockdown argument, because many serious scientific hypotheses about time travel forbid travelling back to a time before the first time machine was invented. In that case, unfortunately, we will never be able to go back and see the dinosaurs. But also it means that we are not invaded by time travellers from the future simply because the first time machine has not yet been invented.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691/0_243_1529_917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein\u2019s equations allowed solutions in which time travel appeared to be possible.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Einstein\u2019s equations allowed solutions in which time travel appeared to be possible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curiously, though, Gleick does not go into much detail about the scientific work on time travel of the last few decades, because he is convinced that physicists working on the subject have just read too much science fiction (they have, he condescendingly writes, been \u201cunwittingly conditioned\u201d by it), and are wasting their own and everyone else\u2019s, um, time. There is, for example, no reference at all to one of the leading such researchers, the astrophysicist J Richard Gott. (Interested readers should consult his excellent book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/time-travel.html\"><em>Time Travel in Einstein\u2019s Universe</em></a>.) On the other hand, the book expends very many pages on laborious plot summaries of more-or-less obscure time-travel fictions of the last century.</p> <p>Nor, moreover, is Gleick much impressed by what he considers the \u201cfutile\u201d philosophical writing on time that he has consulted. One example is the famous 1962 paper on fatalism by Richard Taylor, which begins: \u201cA fatalist \u2013 if there is any such \u2013 thinks he cannot do anything about the future\u201d, so it is \u201cpointless for him to deliberate about what he is going to do\u201d. This started a long and complicated argument in the philosophical literature, an unimportant footnote to which is that, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\">David Foster Wallace</a>\u2019s death, his undergraduate essay on the topic was published, along with Taylor\u2019s original paper, as <em>Fate, Time and Language,</em> in order, or so a cynic might think, to cash in on DFW\u2019s posthumous literary celebrity. Gleick here seems to have just swallowed the publisher\u2019s claim that the future novelist managed to refute Taylor wholesale. At the end of another chapter, with the air of revealing a profound truth, Gleick writes: \u201cWhat is time? Things change, and time is how we keep track.\u201d A fair response would be to ask: \u201cOK, what is change?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's intriguing that Gleick would choose to write a history of an idea that he deems not only impossible by ridiculous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What, then, is Gleick\u2019s cultural diagnosis? He argues that the persistent dream of time travel is a cultural fantasy of escaping the worries of the present, and in particular of eluding death. This is perceptive and no doubt true, but it would still be true even if time travel were in fact theoretically possible. The author, however, seems too impatient to keep an open mind on the matter.</p> <p>This is all rather baffling for any fan of Gleick\u2019s earlier, brilliant works such as <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/genius-316417.html\"><em>Genius</em></a>, his biography of Richard Feynman, and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/chaos.html\"><em>Chaos</em></a>: this writer, after all, more or less invented the modern style of mind-bending scientific non-fiction that does not talk down to its audience. <em>Time Travel</em> is written with his usual elegance, but there is something morose about it, as though, having embarked on the work, he now can\u2019t believe he is obliged to put all these supposedly clever people right about their stupid fantasies. Indeed, one ends the book intrigued mostly by the quirk of authorial psychology by which someone would choose to write a history of an idea that he is convinced is not only impossible but ridiculous.</p> <p>So I prefer the cheerier hypothesis that someone has already made the first time machine in their garage, and the widespread adoption of the technology is going to lead to utter disaster. Luckily, there is a hero who will stop this happening: future James Gleick, who has travelled back in time to smash the time machine he emerges from and write this book to convince everybody that there\u2019s no point ever trying to build another one.

Thanks to Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, it was stamped in the annals of physics more than a century ago at about 1bn km/h. But while general relativity is one of the cornerstones of modern physics, scientists know that the rules of today did not hold at the birth of the universe.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9d8f177f28f32606cc053d3ab72c79622a5f48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9d8f177f28f32606cc053d3ab72c79622a5f48/281_0_4052_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Einstein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thanks to Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is considered to be one of the fundamental constants of nature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Magueijo and Afshordi came up with their theory to explain why the cosmos looks much the same over vast distances. To be so uniform, light rays must have reached every corner of the cosmos, otherwise some regions would be cooler and more dense than others. But even moving at 1bn km/h, light was not travelling fast enough to spread so far and even out the universe\u2019s temperature differences.<br /></p> <p>To overcome the conundrum, cosmologists including Stephen Hawking have proposed a theory called inflation, in which the fledgling universe underwent the briefest spell of the most tremendous expansion. According to inflation, the temperature of the cosmos evened out before it exploded to an enormous size. But there is no solid proof that inflation is right, and if so, what sparked such a massive period of expansion, and what brought it to an end.<br /></p> <p>Magueijo and Afshordi\u2019s theory does away with inflation and replaces it with a variable speed of light. According to their calculations, the heat of universe in its first moments was so intense that light and other particles moved at infinite speed. Under these conditions, light reached the most distant pockets of the universe and made it look as uniform as we see it today. \u201cIn our theory, if you go back to the early universe, there\u2019s a temperature when everything becomes faster. The speed of light goes to infinity and propagates much faster than gravity,\u201d Afshordi said. \u201cIt\u2019s a phase transition in the same way that water turns into steam.\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/07/new-simulation-dark-energy-expansion-of-universe-einstein\">New simulation could shed light on dark energy and expansion of the universe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scientists could soon find out whether light really did outpace gravity in the early universe. The theory predicts a clear pattern in the density variations of the early universe, a feature measured by what is called the \u201cspectral index\u201d. Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.101301\">Physical Review</a>, the scientists predict a very precise spectral index of 0.96478, which is close to the latest, though somewhat rough, measurement of 0.968.</p> <p>Science can never prove the theory right. But Afshordi said that if measurements over the next five years shifted the spectral index away from their prediction, it would rule out their own theory. \u201cIf we are right then inflation is wrong. But the problem with inflation is that you can always fine tune it to fit anything you want,\u201d he said.</p> <p>David Marsh, of the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at Cambridge University, is not giving up on inflation yet. \u201cThe predictions of inflation developed by Stephen Hawking and others more than 30 years ago have been tested by cosmological observations and faced those tests remarkably well. Many scientists regard inflation as a simple and elegant explanation of the origin of galaxies in the universe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And while other theories might also look promising, Marsh said there were elements of Afshordi and Magueijo\u2019s that were not well understood. \u201cIt remains to be seen how robust the predictions are when all the theoretical issues have been addressed,\u201d he said. </p>",

I\u2019m excited by <a href=\"http://www.forensic-architecture.org/\" title=\"\">Forensic Architecture</a>, an interdisciplinary group based at Goldsmiths College in London, which includes artists, journalists, architects, film-makers, lawyers, data analysts and activists.</p> <p>Forensic Architecture is the name of the research group as well as an investigative practice that crosses fields. It is grounded in the use of architecture as an \u201coptical device\u201d, employing forms of spatial analysis, mapping and reconstruction, overlaid with witness testimony and visual documentation. The group has undertaken a series of investigations into human rights violations and acts of state and corporate violence that have informed military, parliamentary and UN inquiries.</p> <p>At the same time, <a href=\"http://mthvn.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Metahaven</a>, a Dutch design studio, deals with information democracy and corporate identity. Its most recent work, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs7NFbE2NS8\" title=\"\">The Sprawl</a>, considered the \u201cways in which fantasy can be designed so as to seem or feel like a truth \u2026 how propaganda multiplies within that upload/download architecture; an architecture in which both fact and fiction can exist side by side and even overlap\u201d.</p> <p>These groups are, in many ways, the contemporary version of the Independent Group, a collection of radical young artists, writers and critics who in the 1950s called the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) their home. And if the groups look similar, then this is because the struggles are too.</p> <p><a href=\"https://frieze.com/article/profile-stefan-kalmar\" title=\"\"><em>Stefan Kalm\u00e1r</em></a><em>, a former Turner prize judge, is the director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts </em></p> <h2><strong>Politics: Ed Miliband</strong></h2> <h2>EMBRACE THE IDEALISM OF THE YOUNG</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a74a8e29f77029328f620f437269ff09ce99db9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a74a8e29f77029328f620f437269ff09ce99db9/0_109_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstration at Downing Street against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As has been proved in previous generations, young people\u2019s vision can lead to long-term change.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A major reason to be cheerful in politics in 2018, and for years to come, is young people. Amid the gloom that has hung over politics and society since Brexit and Trump, young people have represented the most noticeable countervailing force. We saw it this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/09/young-people-spoken-jeremy-corbyn-social-media\" title=\"\">at the general election</a>, and we have seen it in the waves of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/02/biggest-victories-trump-resistance\" title=\"\">young people engaged in the anti-Trump movement</a>, the #MeToo campaign and much else.</p> <p>The significance lies not just in another set of people demanding progressive things, but a set of people with a new set of demands, unencumbered by the past and driven by the circumstances of today. People born after the fall of the Berlin Wall, for many of whom LGBT+ rights, a new wave of feminism, the fight against climate change and an openness to radicalism are part of their generational DNA. When they look at the mess previous generations have made, they are driven to this desire for something better. Our deeply unequal world, including inequality between generations, is turbocharging this movement, which is not scared to demand big change.</p> <p>Their idealism will often be dismissed as naivety or worse, as every wave is always dismissed, including the 1960s wave of feminism and anti-war sentiment. But older generations should resist the \u201cwe know better\u201d impulse, the tendency to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/centrist-dad-labour-corbyn-neoliberal\" title=\"\">being a \u201ccentrist dad\u201d</a> as the term goes. Of course, this idealism is not always right, but its spirit is essential, and the demand it embodies for a new, fairer, more equal society should be embraced.</p> <p>Pessimism and cynicism achieve nothing. By contrast, the energy and vitality of this new generation can help defeat Trump and lead us to build a post-Brexit Britain that doesn\u2019t float off into a low-wage, offshore tax haven.</p> <p>Just as the causes of earlier generations of young people, once dismissed as outlandish and radical, eventually became mainstream, so too it can happen again. They are the best hope for the transformation of the country we are to the country we can become.</p> <p><em>Ed Miliband MP is a former leader of the Labour party and co-presenter of the </em><a href=\"http://cheerful.libsyn.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Reasons to be Cheerful podcast</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Biology<em>: </em>Jim Smith</strong></h2> <h2>INDIVIDUAL GENE SEQUENCING WILL TRANSFORM HEALTH</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88442bcdc3dbc237ea9851cc6fbe5ddb0d56c6b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88442bcdc3dbc237ea9851cc6fbe5ddb0d56c6b6/0_100_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A collection of blood samples\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2018 will see advances in DNA sequencing thanks to samples from UK Biobank volunteers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What we are is determined by our genes and by the sequence of the four chemicals \u2013 nucleotides \u2013 that make up the strands of our DNA. Fifteen years ago scientists sequenced and mapped the DNA in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/04/learned-to-read-genes-now-start-writing-them\" title=\"\">the human genome</a>: they determined the order of the three billion nucleotides that make up our genetic material and they established (roughly) what the different parts of the genome do.</p> <p>That has been extraordinarily powerful in helping us understand how life works and what it is to be human. But to say we have sequenced \u201cthe\u201d human genome is misleading. Our genomes are all different, and if we are to understand susceptibilities to disease, or how people will respond to certain treatments, we need to correlate the health of individual people with their individual DNA sequences.</p> <p>2018 should see this begin to happen. Thanks to advances in DNA sequencing technologies, and contributions from private sources, government and charities, it is now feasible to read the precise DNA sequence in every volunteer recruited to <a href=\"http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Biobank</a>. Set up 10 years ago, UK Biobank represents a cohort of half a million people between 40 and 69, all of whom contribute information about diet, activity, body measurements and other personal information, as well as samples of blood, urine and saliva. Participants have agreed to have their health monitored, and approved researchers from academia and industry have access to all the anonymised data.</p> <p>Already UK Biobank has transformed our understanding of health and disease, improving diagnosis and care for those with cancer and rare diseases. But if every participant has their genome sequenced, the prospects for understanding and treating disease, including obesity and mental health disorders, will be extraordinary. We do not know what we will find, but we can be confident it will transform our understanding of what it is to be healthy and what it is to be sick.</p> <p><em>Dr Jim Smith is a developmental biologist and the director of science at </em><a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Wellcome</em></a><em>, the science and health foundation</em></p> <h2><strong>Infrastructure: Sadie Morgan</strong></h2> <h2>TIME TO BUILD PRIDE IN OUR ROADS AND RAILWAYS</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ebf98be07373c71eb56970faa2afc56651f36d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebf98be07373c71eb56970faa2afc56651f36d6/0_125_3559_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ouse Valley viaduct in Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ouse Valley viaduct in Sussex is a striking example of Britain\u2019s built heritage.

We can say the same about the design of our infrastructure and how it affects people and place. It rarely gets the attention it deserves.</p> <p>As architects and designers our focus has been on buildings at the expense of everything else. We can all think of our favourite building, but can you name a great streetscape, road junction or railway viaduct? That\u2019s because often what defines the infrastructure of our countryside and cities is the miles of security fences, concrete noise barriers and railway stanchions.</p> <p>Reimagining our built environment is one of the greatest opportunities we have to put a healthier, more compassionate and greener philosophy into place.</p> <p>From stations to bridges, roads to railways, electricity pylons to flood defences,our infrastructure should engender national pride and a sense of local ownership.

By November this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/14/post-brexit-vote-surge-uk-inflation-may-have-peaked-3-percent\" title=\"\">it was running at 4.2%</a>, a third higher than the headline rate.</p> <p>In 2018 it is only going to get worse: the price of food will continue to rise ahead of general inflation, and as a weakened pound makes exporting ever more attractive, the major retailers will find themselves locked in competition with international markets for produce. Expect to see the big four supermarkets \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 softening up their customers for higher prices. Meanwhile, the discounters, especially Aldi and Lidl, which keep prices low by restricting choice but buying in enormous volume, will flourish.</p> <p>The optimistic view is that this should all be good for food producers in 2018. In reality, Britain\u2019s farmers have rarely benefited from competition among retailers, which have always prioritised shareholders over suppliers. What\u2019s more, farmers have their own price issues. Few food items are the result of a solely domestic supply chain. They depend on inputs \u2013 seedlings for fruit growing, for example, or animal feeds \u2013 from abroad and the prices of those have also risen. More pressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/21/brexit-coming-food-crisis-seasonal-migrant-labour-eu\" title=\"\">are the accelerating labour issues</a>. British agriculture depends on migrant labour, and there is increasing evidence of a reluctance to come to work here, both because the wages are worth less when sent home, and a growing perception that Britain is a less welcoming place for workers from abroad.</p> <p>This is all going to be felt most keenly in the restaurant sector, which is preparing itself for a brutal 2018. Those ingredient price rises, combined with increased business rates, a shortage of vital staff from abroad and a general softening in consumer confidence, are expected to result in many restaurants going bust. For Britain\u2019s food industry the next 12 months are not expected to be kind.</p> <p><em>Jay Rayner is Observer restaurant critic</em></p> <h2><strong>Space:</strong><em> </em><strong>Maggie Aderin-Pocock</strong></h2> <h2>GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WILL CHANGE ASTRONOMY</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"682ffa7ac3d773cdf54a609acfa25550eba11f88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682ffa7ac3d773cdf54a609acfa25550eba11f88/0_173_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Advances in the understanding of space can be traced back to Einstein and other pioneers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Advances in the understanding of space can be traced back to Einstein and other pioneers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A.

Within it, mass causes distortions in spacetime and this manifests itself as gravity (you may have seen this shown as a distortion of a rubber sheet). A gravitational wave is formed when two or more super massive objects collide, resulting in ripples in spacetime that, like ripples on a pond, expand outwards into space.</p> <p>Einstein published his theory in 1916, but it would take another hundred years, until 2016, for the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\" title=\"\">confirmed detection of a gravitational wave</a>. Why did it take so long?</p> <p>The challenge was that these ripples are minuscule. The measurement needed is the equivalent of detecting a movement of 1mm over the distance between us and Alpha Centauri (our neighbouring star about 25 trillion miles away). It sounds impossible, but the gravitational wave has a very distinct signature that can now be detected.</p> <p>The joy of this is that it gives us a whole new way of doing astronomy.

I suspect this trend of \u201creal\u201d people writing about \u201creal\u201d experiences will continue.</p> <p>But it is fiction that gives voice to our greatest fears and the political upheavals of 2017 have proved a great distraction to the necessary occupation of reading fiction. I can see sweeping love stories that take us away from the Twitter rages of world leaders (Ruth Jones of <em>Gavin and Stacey</em> fame and Jojo Moyes have new books out early in 2018), complex thrillers that take us closer to how the world works (<em>McMafia</em> on BBC1 from 1 January is taken from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/06/society\" title=\"\">Misha Glenny\u2019s book</a> on the links between international crime and business), and fantastical stories to transport us (Harvill\u2019s big debut, <em>The Mermaid &amp; Mrs Hancock</em> by Imogen Hermes Gowar).</p> <p>Added to this, the Weinstein earthquake and its inability to swallow Trump will result in a new narrative conversation. In the 80s and 90s, movies such as <em>Fatal Attraction</em>, <em>Basic Instinct</em> and <em>Disclosure</em> emerged from Hollywood\u2019s sense of a perceived threat posed by a new working female population, and I suspect Hollywood will find a way to give voice to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/21/we-created-the-metoo-movement-now-its-time-for-hertoo\" title=\"\">the #MeToo movement</a>. I also believe one response to \u201cpopulism\u201d will be detailed and specific stories of human struggle, filled with nuance, complexity and ambiguity. Most of all, the huge diversity of voices in Britain that have been waiting to be heard will find a place in the mainstream, and as we move away from continental Europe politically and economically, we will find expression in the bigger questions and multifarious voices in this country.</p> <p><em>Jonny Geller is a writer, book agent and joint chief executive of Curtis Brown</em></p>",

          "body": "<p>Long before homo sapiens was up on its hind legs, two black holes \u2013 each more massive than two dozen suns \u2013 were swirling around each other in outer space at a colossal rate. They merged with such violence that the very fabric of space and time shook, the ripples spreading out across the universe.</p> <p>A little more than a billion years later, in the early hours of 14 September 2015, some of those ripples were detected by scientists in the US. By any standards, this was a truly remarkable achievement. The astronomers had managed to identify a disturbance that had lasted only 20 milliseconds \u2013 much briefer than the blink of an eye \u2013 and was smaller than a millionth of the width of an atom. They had found the first direct evidence of gravitational waves, a feat likely to be rewarded soon with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nobelprizes\">Nobel prize</a>.</p> <p>In <em>Ripples in Spacetime</em>, the Dutch astronomy journalist Govert Schilling gives us a lively and readable account of the waves\u2019 discovery. They had first appeared in the mind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Albert Einstein</a> almost a century before, after he deduced their existence from his new theory of gravity. For reasons that Schilling does not make entirely clear, Einstein twice doubted that the waves existed but was eventually convinced that they should be part of nature\u2019s fabric.</p> <p>Einstein apparently did not spend much time contemplating the possibility of discerning these waves. This was probably because, according to his theory, they interact so feebly with ordinary matter that they would be almost certainly impossible to detect in the foreseeable future. Theorists later calculated that it might just be possible to detect them, presumably emitted in the aftermath of violent collisions between massive, compact objects in outer space. Schilling spends a good deal of time making sure that we understand all this. \u201cBuckle up for a crash course in astrophysics,\u201d he tells us, before delivering a clear, pacy narrative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f16ec4453c9f711f0286ad952794de16c1b11b9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f16ec4453c9f711f0286ad952794de16c1b11b9d/0_130_4399_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a 2016 press conference in Washington a screen shows gravitational waves that scientists observed with the Ligo detector.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a 2016 press conference in Washington a screen shows gravitational waves that scientists observed with the Ligo detector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Astronomers detected a distur\u00adbance that was smaller than a millionth of the width of an atom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All great scientific discoveries open up new lines of research, and pose more questions than answers. This one is no different. Schilling underlines that this discovery is the opening of a new window on the universe, the beginning of a new branch of science. Astronomers will no longer be limited to observing space through the waves of electricity and magnetism (for example, visible light) entering telescopes, but will be able to observe it through waves of gravity. Galileo would have been amazed.</p> <p>The design of the huge apparatus that first detected the waves exploits the fact that when the waves pass through, its<strong> </strong>dimensions are minutely altered. The change is much too small to see directly, even using the most powerful microscope. Calculations showed, however, that it should be possible to measure the change by exploiting the extremely subtle interference between beams of light from lasers. Hence the acronym Ligo, short for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.</p> <p>The Ligo authorities built two identical observatories, one in Hanford, Washington State, in the US, and the other over 3,000km away, in Livingston, Louisiana. This doubling-up enabled experimenters at the observatories to check each other\u2019s results \u2013 if only one of them appeared to detect the waves, no one would have believed it. As Ligo\u2019s director later said, it was \u201ctruly a scientific moonshot\u201d.</p> <p>Plans for detecting gravitational waves began to take shape in 1960, five years after Einstein\u2019s death. Several scientists contributed innovative ideas, but, according to Schilling, Ligo was the brainchild of three scientists: the Scot Ronald Drever, and the Americans Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss. The US National Science Foundation bankrolled the enterprise, conceived, built and operated by the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Valuable contributions were made by a few other leading academic institutions (some in the UK), but most kept their distance, deeming the project too speculative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2718d783e0ca539c288a589963108c4190efe884\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2718d783e0ca539c288a589963108c4190efe884/0_248_850_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Ligo Livingston Laboratory in Louisiana.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of Ligo Livingston Laboratory in Louisiana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LIGO.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Schilling expertly guides us through the development of the venture, highlighting the personal clashes and technical problems that put it in jeopardy. By the early 1990s, it was in deep trouble. The brilliantly inventive Drever was thrown off the team and even found himself locked out of his office. Two years later, the project\u2019s principal investigator was replaced by the experienced experimentalist Barry Barish, who put it back on the rails. He later described the authorities\u2019 agreement to continue to fund it after 1994, despite an alarming hike in the budget, as \u201ca miracle\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Schilling expertly guides us through the\u00a0venture, showing the personal clashes and problems that put it in jeopardy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By 2015, about 1,000 scientists and engineers were working on the project, which had racked up a cost of more than $1bn. But it was suddenly all worth it. Astronomers detected a tiny disturbance that clearly signalled the discovery of gravitational waves, emitted by merging black holes exactly as Einstein\u2019s theory had predicted. The gravitational waves emitted in this single collision had a power that was much greater than the output of all the stars in the universe combined.</p> <p>The Ligo officials announced the discovery almost five months later. The science had to be watertight. A few years before, astronomers working on another project had rushed to announce the sensational discovery of gravitational waves formed early in the universe, but the evidence \u2013 splashed across front pages all over the world \u2013 turned out to be a handful of dust.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/22/hunt-is-on-gravity-waves-spacewatch\">The hunt is on for gravity waves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In decades to come, Ligo and other detectors will be able to monitor bursts of gravitational waves with ever-increasing precision. The team has already detected them from a few other black hole mergers, and waves emitted from mergers between these and other exotic cosmic objects are expected to be commonplace in the near future.</p> <p>Yet all this depends on maintaining adequate funding for basic research. One of the heroes of Schillings\u2019s story is an institution \u2013 the US\u2019s farsighted and patient <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\">National Science Foundation</a>. If the gravity waves discovery is awarded the Nobel prize in physics on 3 October, it will be interesting to see whether it will, in keeping with tradition, be shared among a maximum of three scientists. That would seem invidious: it is time the Nobel authorities awarded the credit for such successful big-science projects to an entire team.</p> <p>\u2022 Graham Farmelo\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/churchill-s-bomb.html\"><em>Churchill\u2019s Bomb</em></a> is published by Faber. <em>Ripples in Spacetime: Einstein, Gravitational Waves and the Future of Astronomy</em> by Govert Schilling (Harvard, \u00a323.95).

Using imaging techniques, the fluorescent substance was seen to be released at about nine days, 20 days or 41 days, depending on the polymer used.</p> <p>The team also produced microparticles filled with a polio vaccine and exposed them to an antibody test to see if the vaccine\u2019s potency was affected by the heat sealing: no such problem was detected. </p> <p>Finally, mice were injected with two sets of microparticles made from different polymers \u2013 one designed to break down after about one week and the other after about five weeks \u2013 with both containing a protein found in egg white. The animals\u2019 immune response was tracked for 16 weeks. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The results reveal that the filled microparticles triggered a response greater than two regular injections of the same dose of protein spaced four weeks apart. Indeed, the response was on a par with that from two regular injections each with twice the dose \u2013 probably down to the microparticles themselves boosting the immune response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/einstein-inspired-isobar-vaccine-cooling-system-wins-uk-james-dyson-award\">Einstein-inspired Isobar vaccine cooling system wins UK James Dyson award</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The team say the approach could have myriad applications in medicine and beyond. \u201c You could use pH sensitive materials [or] you can fill with any type of drug, or therapeutic or sensing drug, so we think it has a lot more application than just vaccines,\u201d said Jaklenec.</p> <p>But, she added, challenges remain, not least that vaccines are normally stored in refrigerators: \u201c[We] have to stabilise all of these vaccines in the body for a long period of time at elevated temperature,\u201d she said.<br /></p> <p>Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at the University of Oxford, was optimistic, although he noted it was early days.</p> <p>\u201cTechnologies which allow slow or timed release of a dose and thus reduce the \u2018needle burden\u2019 of an immunisation programme without compromising protection would be welcomed by healthcare workers, parents and their offspring,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>David Goldblatt, professor of vaccinology and immunology at University College London, said the approach was sophisticated. <br /></p> <p>But, he warned, hurdles remain, noting that it removed the chance to modify vaccines between doses and that there was no way to adjust the timing of vaccine release after injection. \u201cWe prefer to avoid immunising when you might have an active viral infection,\u201d he said. \u201c[What happens] if a child has malaria on the day that the [vaccine dose] is released automatically?\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, he said, the approach could prove revolutionary in helping children in developing countries to receive adequate vaccination. \u201cIt could be a game changer for that,\u201d he said. <br /></p>",

Goya may even have intended it as an allegory of the season, for it is a design for a tapestry to hang in the Spanish royal palace El Pardo, part of a series of such designs that were his first major commissions. The young Goya\u2019s brightly coloured tapestry designs rejoice in (apparently) simple evocations of seasonal fun and festivals, like this portrayal of a country doctor warming his hands over a dish of hot coals while his two students huddle by him in the bleak midwinter. The fiery red of the doctor\u2019s cloak contrasts brilliantly with a stark leafless tree behind him, while warm russet faces look out of the picture with a glow of winter cheer. This is an optimistic painting. It is not only an evocation of winter but of reason. Goya believed fervently in the scientific ideals of the European Enlightenment, which held that education and technology could improve life. When he painted this early work there were real hopes of the Enlightenment spreading to Spain. This doctor can stand the cold because he is warmed by reason, in the shape of the medical books that lie open in front of him. Goya would later see reason destroyed by war and smothered by superstition but in this heartwarming work he expresses his hope for humanity.<br />\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/4978/el-m%C3%A9dico-doctor\">Scottish National Gallery</a>, Edinburgh.</p> <h2>Image of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143313ffede0b1823ade0fe6fdbae8af7f0b39a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/143313ffede0b1823ade0fe6fdbae8af7f0b39a9/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Dubai Frame in Zabeel Park, Dubai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/01/dubai-frame-uaes-latest-surreal-landmark-frames-a-controversy\">The Dubai Frame</a> <br /></strong>The world\u2019s largest picture frame has been unveiled in Dubai.

One doesn\u2019t have to be Einstein to work out that 14 gallons of semen would require 12,740 ejaculations of five millilitres volume (the oft-quoted average). This would mean an average of just over four ejaculations per week, every week for a 60-year period (or five per week over 50 years, etc), say from early teens to early seventies.

          "body": "<p>Tonight at the Royal Society, London, around a dozen women will be presented with <a href=\"http://csc.mrc.ac.uk/research/research-facilities/women-science/\">Suffrage Science</a> awards. Organised by the Medical Research Council\u2019s Clinical Science Centre, Imperial College, they honour women\u2019s contributions to science and are timing to coincide with <a href=\"http://www.internationalwomensday.com/\">International Women\u2019s Day</a>.</p> <p> One of today\u2019s awardees is Pippa Goldschmidt. She is being honoured for her work in science communication. With a PhD in astronomy, Goldschmidt is now forging a career in the literary world. Her first novel<em> </em>The Falling Sky about an astronomer struggling to come to terms with her past was runner-up in the Dundee International Book Prize 2013.</p> <p> Her latest project is editing the short story collection I Am Because You Are. These stories all take their inspiration from Albert Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity, which is currently celebrating its 100th anniversary.</p> <p> Having supplied a short story of my own to the collection, I caught up with Goldschmidt to ask her about the fine line between science and fiction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4e343efe7dc4064d9444f6fc646d3c81bfa7d8c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e343efe7dc4064d9444f6fc646d3c81bfa7d8c8/0_0_1524_2339/652.jpg\" alt=\"I Am Because You Are book cover\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I Am Because You Are book cover</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Freight Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Why celebrate General Relativity with short stories?</strong></h2> <p>Einstein was a very imaginative scientist who frequently came up with \u2018thought experiments\u2019 \u2013 experiments that could never be carried out in real life, and yet could be used to make logical deductions about our world. He populated the abstract landscapes of his theories with people and familiar everyday objects such as trains, clocks and torches. This helped him (and us!) get to grips with the formidably complex ideas and their consequences. </p> <p> It takes a truly creative imagination to come up with these thought experiments and they\u2019ve always reminded me of short stories, so when I realised that the 100th anniversary of general relativity would fall in November last year, I thought that a suitable celebration of Einstein\u2019s achievement might be an anthology of specially commissioned short stories. It also felt appropriate that this sort of celebration - through the medium of literature rather than science - would be somewhat outside the scientific orthodoxy - as was Einstein himself for much of his career.</p> <p> I approached a number of writers who were very enthusiastic and keen to explore the subject in a creative way. And we were very pleased to get backing for the project from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (the research council that funds astronomy in the UK) \u2013 they clearly recognise that stories about science are a good way of reaching out to the public.</p> <h2><strong>What can fiction bring to science?</strong></h2> <p>Science is too often a closed book for many people, they study it at school and are bored by it, or find it difficult or irrelevant to their lives. But fiction has this incredible ability to reflect and examine all aspects of the real world, and writing fiction about science is a great way of opening it up to new audiences, and helping to demystify it.</p> <p> Science is also heavily reliant on literary concepts, such as metaphors, to get its points across; we often hear the phrases \u2018the Universe is like an expanding balloon\u2019, or \u2018DNA is like an alphabet\u2019. So I think fiction and science have more in common with each other than may first appear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8be3cdca6803693190c47f963610cece79bdcf79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8be3cdca6803693190c47f963610cece79bdcf79/0_0_686_858/400.jpg\" alt=\"Former astronomer turned author Pippa Goldschmidt\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former astronomer turned author Pippa Goldschmidt will collect a \u2018Suffrage Science\u2019 award tonight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Goldschmidt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Does fiction about science have to be more about the scientists rather than science?</strong></p> <p>The challenge in writing about science lies in developing a story which can appeal to emotions as well as intellect. I think in particular it is difficult to write a story about physical sciences (as opposed to the life sciences) that is able to do that, because the subject matter is necessarily more removed from the human experience. It\u2019s tricky to place particle physics or cosmology centre stage in your story \u2013 not impossible, but more difficult than, say, writing about genetics or medicine. So it\u2019s easier to appeal to readers if you bring in the human element \u2013 the story of the scientists themselves as well as their work.</p> <p>The science has to be worked into the story so it helps drive forward the plot, it has to be more than a decoration.</p> <h2><strong>Is science the new history when it comes to fiction?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, I think it could be. One example of fiction about a difficult historical subject which has helped to convey that subject to a huge number of readers is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s novel <em>Half of a Yellow Sun</em>, focusing on a group of Nigerian people and their experiences of the Biafran war. I love that novel and yet I really doubt I would have picked up a non-fiction account of that event. </p> <p> Historical fiction is rightly popular because it brings to life distant people and times and helps us understand them, and their influence on us. Fiction about science can do the same thing, because it\u2019s ideally suited to investigating the inner lives of characters, showing what they think and feel, what motivates them, how they react to external circumstances, how they adapt to new challenges and cope with pressures and conflicts.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Because-You-are-Celebrating-Relativity/dp/1910449261\">I Am Because You Are, An Anthology of Stories Celebrating the Centenary of the General Theory of Relativity</a></em> is edited by Pippa Goldschmidt and Tania Hershman (Freight Books).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/\"><em>Stuart Clark</em></a><em> is the author of </em><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skys-Dark-Labyrinth-Trilogy-Book/dp/1846972159/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457365145&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+SKy%27s+Dark+Labyrinth\">The Sky\u2019s Dark Labyrinth </a></em><em> trilogy (Polygon), and co-host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.acast.com/stuniverse\"><em>The Stuniverse</em></a><em> (</em><em>Bingo Productions</em><em>).</em></p>",

          "body": "<h2>The Durrells <br />8pm, ITV</h2> <p>A second series of the charming comedy-drama adapted from Gerald Durrell\u2019s Corfu Trilogy. Gerry\u2019s brothers have decided to grow moustaches; mum Louisa (Keeley Hawes) unexpectedly wakes up next to a sheep \u2013 although new arrival Hugh Jarvis (Daniel Lapaine), a dashing farmer, would much rather she woke up beside him instead; and boy-crazy Margo has decided she wants to become a nun. Meanwhile, an ecstatic Gerry has discovered some otter droppings \u2026 <em>Ali Catterall</em> </p> <h2>Bigheads <br />7pm, ITV</h2> <p>The ghost of It\u2019s a Knockout haunts this strange new gameshow, where members of the public try to complete physical tasks while lumbering around wearing grotesque likenesses of Trump, Adele, Mo Farah and even Einstein. The games typically involve either falling down or being knocked over, providing fitful, mindless entertainment. Jason Manford hosts, but the real energy comes from Jenny Powell and Kriss Akabusi in the commentary box. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Line of Duty <br />9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>The penultimate episode of the peerless corruption drama and AC-12 are processing the implications of Hilton\u2019s recusal. As better men than Hilton have discovered, this lot are no fun when they\u2019re angry. But even so, our heroes are stretched to the limit here. And then there\u2019s DCI Huntley. Thandie Newton\u2019s performance is increasingly startling: borderline psychopathic blankness beginning to dissolve into something more fragile and, accordingly, more dangerous. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Grantchester <br />9pm, ITV</h2> <p>\u201cHow does a man drown in the middle of a church?\u201d Good question, and one that much concerns vicar Sidney Chambers and detective Geordie Keating as the likable, 1950s-set crime drama returns. It\u2019s an investigation that eventually leads the duo to a decidedly spooky institution. Meanwhile, Sidney\u2019s relationship with married Amanda deepens, an ongoing plot development that\u2019s echoed in the personal travails of Geordie and closeted curate Leonard Finch. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>The Island With Bear Grylls <br />9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Youth is pitted against experience in this latest series of Bear Grylls\u2019s survival challenge show. An old and a young team are marooned under the watchful eye of the Chief Scout, with 66-year-old Frank heading up the veterans while the kids are led by 18-year-old Freddie, the youngest of the lot. Perhaps predictably, while Frank\u2019s group are busy making fire, Freddie\u2019s is soon lost in the jungle suffering exhaustion and dehydration. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Genius: Einstein <br />9pm, National Geographic</h2> <p>Nat Geo\u2019s first scripted series is a bio-drama flipping between disobedient student Einstein (the magnetic Johnny Flynn) and revered but still fizzy middle-aged Einstein (Geoffrey Rush). The elder man is a Jew in Berlin as Nazism rises. An irresistible story, the more so for an unusual emphasis on Albert\u2019s personality and politics \u2013 so it survives Ron Howard\u2019s unsubtle direction and a support cast full of Brits with loose German accents. <em>Jack Seale</em><br /></p> <h2>Cyberwar <br />9pm, Viceland</h2> <p>Ben Makuch investigates Israel\u2019s growing enthusiasm for keyboard-engineered espionage with the government expanding efforts to become a cyber superpower. With military service mandatory, a stream of young Israelis keener on manipulating RAM than emulating Rambo aim for the Israeli Intelligence Agency\u2019s digital division, not least for the promise of highly paid jobs following their service. Makuch also speaks to potentially targeted Palestinians. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em><br /></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Amazing Spider-Man 2, (Marc Webb, 2014), 6.15pm, ITV2</strong><br />Among the plethora of Spider-Men, this is the one between the Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire trilogy and the upcoming Jon Watts/Tom Holland version. Still, there\u2019s undeniably a real buzz about Andrew Garfield\u2019s endearingly gawky Peter Parker-cum-web-slinger, who is wrestling with teen-love problems \u2013 girlfriend Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) dumps him \u2013 and a crackling new super villain in Jamie Foxx\u2019s Electro. <em>Paul Howlett</em><br /><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>The Sessions, (Ben Lewin, 2012), 12midnight, Channel 4</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd43e3bdffa6cb4555ada031a1ff5be3d1f2f37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd43e3bdffa6cb4555ada031a1ff5be3d1f2f37/276_0_3805_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sessions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sessions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.FoxSearch/Everett / Rex Featur</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s an awkward subject handled rather well. It\u2019s based on the true story of Mark O\u2019Brien (John Hawkes), a California poet mostly confined \u2013 by childhood polio \u2013 to an iron lung. Nearing 40, he decides it\u2019s time to lose his virginity, which leads him to sex therapist Cheryl (Helen Hunt). You couldn\u2019t call it unsentimental, but it\u2019s also well-acted, funny and sweetly moving. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><br /><strong>The Players, (Gilles Lellouche, Eric Lartigau, Michel Hazanavicius, Jean Dujardin, Alexandre Court\u00e8s, Fred Cavay\u00e9, Emmanuelle Bercot, 2012), 1.30am, Film4</strong><br />A French portmanteau movie stuffed with amour fou. The original title, Les Infid\u00e8les, better describes the antics of Jean Dujardin (Oscar-winner for the Artist) and Gilles Lellouche in a series of sketches illustrating a certain Gallic-male inability to be faithful to one\u2019s wife; for instance, one propositions women at a conference, the other is a dentist struggling in an affair with a young patient. If the aim is to make the two look ridiculous and tacky, The Players succeeds. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>World Championship Snooker</strong> More green-baize action from Sheffield. 10am, BBC2</p> <p><strong>FA Cup Football: Arsenal v Manchester City</strong> The second semi-final from Wembley Stadium. 2.30pm, BT Sport 1</p> <p><strong>IPL Cricket: Kolkata Knight Riders v Royal Challengers Bangalore</strong> Big money T20 action from Eden Gardens, Kolkata. 3pm, Sky Sports 2 </p>",

The waves, which were predicted by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3bn years for the waves to arrive at the Ligo detector in the USA. </p> <p>The signal was extremely weak when it reached Earth, but is already promising a revolution in astrophysics. Gravitational waves are an entirely new way of observing the most violent events in space and testing the limits of our knowledge.</p> <p>Ligo, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is a collaborative project with over one thousand researchers from more than twenty countries. Together, they have realised a vision that is almost fifty years old. The 2017 Nobel Laureates have, with their enthusiasm and determination, each been invaluable to the success of Ligo. Pioneers Rainer Weiss and Kip S Thorne, together with Barry C Barish, the scientist and leader who brought the project to completion, ensured that four decades of effort led to gravitational waves finally being observed.</p> <p> In the mid-1970s, Rainer Weiss had already analysed possible sources of background noise that would disturb measurements, and had also designed a detector, a laser-based interferometer, which would overcome this noise. Early on, both Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss were firmly convinced that gravitational waves could be detected and bring about a revolution in our knowledge of the universe. </p> <p>Gravitational waves spread at the speed of light, filling the universe, as Albert Einstein described in his general theory of relativity. They are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other. Einstein was convinced it would never be possible to measure them. The Ligo project\u2019s achievement was using a pair of gigantic laser interferometers to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus, as the gravitational wave passed the Earth. </p> <p>So far all sorts of electromagnetic radiation and particles, such as cosmic rays or neutrinos, have been used to explore the universe. However, gravitational waves are direct testimony to disruptions in spacetime itself. This is something completely new and different, opening up unseen worlds. A wealth of discoveries awaits those who succeed in capturing the waves and interpreting their message. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T10:30:38.440Z\">at 11.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59d3637ee4b0563a9b0f8d60\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T10:17:42.123Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MIT have a good video explaining how the Ligo detector works.

Ever since then have the gravitational wavs sped through the universe, reaching our cosmic neighbourhood, the Magellanic cloud, about 200,000 years ago when early <em>Homo sapiens</em> walked in Africa, and finally swept to the Earth on September 14th 2015 when the waves were recorded by perhaps the most sensitive instrument ever devised by man: the Ligo interferometer gravitational wave observatory.</p> <p>This event caused a sensation worldwide.

Rainer Weiss, emeritus professor at MIT, was central to designing the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) which detected the ripples in spacetime. Weiss worked on plans for the instrument with Ronald Drever, a Scot based at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), who, sadly, died earlier this year.

But they also propose Mitchell Feigenbaum at Rockefeller University for his work on nonlinear and chaotic physical systems and for the identification of the Feigenbaum constant (don\u2019t ask); and Rashid A Sunyaev, director of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, for his work on the origins of the universe, galactic formation processes, disc accretion of black holes, and other cosmological phenomena.

Or so it must seem to those who spent decades designing and building the exquisite instruments needed to sense the minuscule ripples in spacetime that Albert Einstein foresaw in his 1915 theory of general relativity.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">first gravitational wave</a> bagged by physicists reached Earth on 14 September 2015 and sent a quiver through the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo).

When massive objects merge, this curvature can be altered, sending ripples out across the universe. These are known as gravitational waves.By the time these disturbances reach us, they are almost imperceptible. It was only a century after Einstein's prediction that scientists developed a detector sensitive enough - the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory or Ligo - and were able to confirm the existence of gravitational waves.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Each of the gravitational waves had been set in motion by violent collisions between black holes more than a billion years ago. But while detecting the waves was feat enough to land the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/03/nobel-prize-physics-discovery-gravitational-waves-ligo\">Nobel prize in physics for Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne</a>, what excites astronomers now is what they stand to learn about the universe.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a story in two parts,\u201d said Sheila Rowan, director of the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow. \u201cThe first part was the quest to make these instruments sensitive enough to make the first detection, but that\u2019s the end of one story and the start of another. We are really on the threshold of a whole new way to study our universe and that\u2019s hugely exciting.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>Until now, astronomers have mapped the heavens almost exclusively with telescopes that gather light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Optical telescopes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/hubble-space-telescope\">such as Hubble</a>, have allowed scientists to gaze deep into the history of the universe, but these observations hit a hard limit at about 400,000 years after the big bang: back then, the universe was opaque to light.</p> \n<p>Gravitational waves are not so easily blocked. Although they are weak, they are hard to mask, and so future observations of the waves could allow scientists to break through the optical limit and see what the universe looked like moments after the big bang.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cAt some point, not with the detectors we have now, we hope to be able to look at the beginnings of the universe,\u201d said Rainer Weiss, the physicist at MIT who shared Tuesday\u2019s Nobel prize in physics with other members of the Ligo team. </p> \n<p>\u201cThere are calculations that indicate that the very earliest instants of the universe, right after the universe gets born, there is an enormous amount of background radiation of gravitational waves generated. That would be one of the most fascinating things man could [see] because it will tell you very much how the universe starts.\u201d<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a428d86e-805b-4c4d-997a-e687036ed6e2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MVqy5WlO7pY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The earliest gravitational waves were probably emitted a fraction of a second after the big bang, when the universe went from being smooth and structureless to clumpy, at which point spacetime became \u201cbendy\u201d. </p> \n<p>Professor Andreas Freise, a Ligo project scientist at the University of Birmingham, said: \u201cOne of the mysteries is how we get from there to now where everything is clumpy.\u201d </p> \n<p>The transition is thought to have left a gravitational wave imprint on the entire universe, which might be visible with future detectors more sensitive than Ligo.</p> \n<p>There are plenty more phenomena scientists hope to spot sooner. Gravitational waves spread out from cosmic events that accelerate huge quantities of matter. This happens when a star explodes, but until now, all astronomers have seen is the bright flash of light that marks a star\u2019s death. By studying gravitational waves, scientists hope to learn for the first time what happens inside a collapsing star. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt should produce a gravitational wave signal and it\u2019s a signal that would give us information that currently we can\u2019t get any other way, because it\u2019s about what\u2019s happening inside a collapsing star,\u201d Rowan said.<br></p> \n<p>When Ligo switched on, scientists thought that the first waves they spotted were likely to come from collisions between neutron stars, some of the most exotic entities in the universe. Neutron stars form when massive stars die. They have crusts and crystalline cores and are incredibly dense: a teaspoon of neutron star weighs as much as Mount Everest.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome supernovae explode and end up as black holes, but others end up as neutron stars,\u201d said Pedro Ferreira, professor of astrophysics at Oxford University and author of the 2014 book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~pgf/Pedro_Ferreira/The_Perfect_Theory.html\">The Perfect Theory: a century of geniuses and the battle over general relativity</a>. \u201cThe thing the Ligo scientists expected to see, and might see soon, are two neutron stars orbiting each other and coming together. If you can see these events you start learning about fundamental physics, and that is pretty amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other countries, including Japan and India, have plans to build their own gravitational wave detectors. More ambitiously, the European Space Agency intends to send an observatory into space in 2034. Known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/22/hunt-is-on-gravity-waves-spacewatch\">Lisa, for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna</a>, the mission aims to detect far weaker gravitational waves than is possible on Earth.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cMany of us who were in this thing fully expect that we\u2019re going to learn things that we didn\u2019t know about,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cWe knew about black holes other ways, and we knew about neutron stars. We hope that there are all sorts of phenomena that you can see mostly because of the gravitational waves they emit. That will open a new science.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 December 2017 to correct the date Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity from 1905 to 1915.<br></p>",

As well as being a peerless scientist, he showed great wisdom and integrity \u2013 he was an outstanding humanitarian. One hundred years ago, he completed his theory of relativity, setting out a theory of gravity that would surpass Isaac <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/isaac-newton\" title=\"\">Newton</a>\u2019s and which continues to shape\u00a0our understanding of the universe today.</p> <p>Einstein had emerged 10 years earlier, apparently from nowhere, to\u00a0give the world\u2019s leading scientists a\u00a0series of physics lessons they would never forget. During his 20-year golden streak,\u00a0ending in 1925, he did more than\u00a0anyone else to reshape the understanding of space, time, energy, matter and gravity. He pioneered the crucial idea that symmetry is at the heart of fundamental laws of nature. He\u00a0could be practically minded, too: with his Hungarian friend Leo Szilard, he came\u00a0up with an innovative design for a\u00a0fridge,\u00a0which they patented\u00a0in 1930.</p> <p>Although he valued his solitude \u2013 he once said he would happily live in a\u00a0lighthouse \u2013 he was a considerate colleague and friend. His astonishing insight into nature was matched by his understanding of human affairs, and his quotations and popular essays still reward re-reading. Deeply engaged with\u00a0politics, he spoke out against hypernationalism and fought against the persecution of Jews and other minorities. His friend and colleague in the 1950s, N\u00e1ndor Bal\u00e1zs, once told me that Einstein\u2019s main weakness was his impatience with people beating a path to his door. On one occasion, a young woman travelled all the way from Bombay to Princeton, simply to talk\u00a0to\u00a0him. He reluctantly agreed, groaning:\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0suppose I have to go and play God again.\u201d When I asked Bal\u00e1zs whether Einstein was a saint, he shot back: \u201cNo, he was better than that \u2013 he\u00a0was human.\u201d</p>",

Though they span vastly different scientific disciplines, they all have one thing in common \u2013 they are all Nobel prize winners.</p> <p>Nobel laureates give a human face to science, a discipline that can often seem anonymous to those who aren\u2019t directly involved. They are great figures in history whose discoveries have transformed our understanding of the universe and in many cases improved our lives in ways that cannot be overestimated.</p> <p>So when the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/prize_announcements/index.html\" title=\"\">2017 Nobel prizes</a> are awarded, we will once again celebrate individuals who have thought differently, taken risks with their work and, in doing so, have made huge leaps forward.</p> <p>But there is also a danger when the Nobels are such a prominent way of celebrating science. Even lone geniuses \u2013 Einstein working in a patent office, for instance \u2013 are a product of their scientific environment and times, building on work done by others and benefiting from feedback from their colleagues. If we rely too heavily on the narrative that science is the history of great men and \u2013 too seldom \u2013 great women, we underestimate how much it is a result of team work and partnerships.</p> <p>Today, even in the individual labs of most leading scientists, the results are invariably born of a joint effort. Anyone who has been to a conference cannot have missed the slides at the end of nearly every presentation that credit the whole team \u2013 from technician, to PhD student, to eminent professor. On an even larger scale, think of the jubilant mission control room of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/curiosity-rover\" title=\"\">Mars Curiosity rover</a>; the thousands of collaborators at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/cern\" title=\"\">Cern </a>who validated the existence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Higgs boson</a>; or the international teams that over 13 years sequenced the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\" title=\"\">human genome</a>. These stories are powerful too.</p> <p>And if we look towards some of the great challenges of our time \u2013 tackling the problem of clean and sustainable energy, providing sufficient food for a growing planet, developing new genetic technologies to improve health, or harnessing the power of the digital revolution, we start to see how difficult it will be for any one individual to take any of them on alone. The same is true for fundamental science such as understanding the working of the brain or the origin of the universe.</p> <p>Collaboration brings fresh ideas and new perspectives. Bringing people together from diverse backgrounds, often across borders, leads to new ways of thinking, better solutions and faster progress.</p> <p>We need to celebrate this collaboration more than ever, because it doesn\u2019t happen on its own. It needs an environment that encourages researchers to build international and interdisciplinary teams, to work in different countries, to attack problems that no one person, or nation, can solve alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bringing people together from diverse backgrounds leads to new ways of thinking, better thinking  and faster progress</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For 50 years, systems, often invisible, have been carefully constructed to make collaboration possible. Universities have welcomed students from their local communities, from around the country and from around the world, all of whom will lead tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs. Funding has been put in place, through the European Union and other pan-continental schemes, which fund excellence wherever it\u2019s found. And policies that allow data sharing, multi-hospital clinical trials and open access publishing of results have been implemented to ease the mechanics of science across borders.</p> <p>But this environment is fragile and uncertain. The growing political success of populist nationalism risks puts these systems and values, so carefully constructed and argued for, at risk.</p> <p>The cracks are already appearing. Travel bans mean that scientists, often from nations working hard to improve their scientific capability, increasingly cannot collaborate or take part in international meetings and projects.</p> <p>Uncertainty over eligibility for EU research funding under the \u20ac77bn research and innovation programme for 2014-2020, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/\" title=\"\">Horizon 2020</a>, after March 2019 means that scientists based in the UK have been excluded from grants, have abandoned potential collaborations or have chosen to work in a country with more certain funding options. A warmer tone, such as we saw last week from Theresa May in her Florence speech on Brexit, or, even better, a clear commitment to remaining in Horizon 2020, would remove this doubt in a stroke.</p> <p>And for climate scientists, seeing the US withdraw from the Paris climate accord has been a huge blow to progress on a problem that can only be solved with joint action.</p> <p>It\u2019s up to people who, like me, believe in the power of science to speak up for the systems and principles that make collaboration possible. It means making the case for flexible, welcoming immigration that allows the movement of talented people and teams across borders in order to take global action against global problems.</p> <p>We can also reach out to leading science nations and emerging superpowers to create better, stronger and more equal scientific partnerships. At <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Wellcome,</a> we have joined together with some of the greatest scientific institutions in the world, from <a href=\"https://www.mpg.de/en\" title=\"\">Max Planck</a>, to the <a href=\"https://aasciences.ac.ke/\" title=\"\">African Academy of Sciences</a>, to the <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, to support building these bridges.</p> <p>Together, science can, with the support of society, solve the world\u2019s most pressing challenges and make discoveries that will further our knowledge and improve our lives in ways we cannot imagine today.</p> <p>Individuals can achieve a lot, but teams can achieve much more. We are looking forward to celebrating the new Nobel laureates. But let\u2019s also celebrate the collaborators and environment that made their work possible.</p> <p><em>Jeremy Farrar is director of Wellcome.

He came up with the slogan \u201cPeace, Love and Understanding\u201d. In the end, the park could only afford one word. Which to choose? A tricky situation for a man who reckons that making choices might be a form of arrogance, who has turned procrastination into an art form and has invented a new word \u2013 Nosey \u2013 that combines both yes and no. He went for Understanding, not least for the idea that people would actually stand underneath it, creating a sly visual joke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/04/edinburgh-festival-2017-10-shows-to-see\">Edinburgh festival 2017: 10 shows to see</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This impish sense of humour and refusal to take himself too seriously inform this 80 minutes in which Creed sings some of the songs written for his three albums, including the recent digital single <a href=\"http://martincreed.com/site/works/work-no.-2811\">What the Fuck Am I Doing?</a> (even though his mum and dad are in the audience and they don\u2019t like swearing). He shows us some of his art, and wrestles with words and feelings. The feelings are too big and slippery to be encompassed by the words and require music to express them. He\u2019s not entirely sure that he wants to be here. When he said yes to this residency all those months ago, did he really mean no? Or has his yes become a no, and is that no now becoming a yes as he stands in front of us?</p> <p>It\u2019s clearly complicated being inside Creed\u2019s head, a place where he sometimes goes to parties, meets himself, holds conversations in which he doesn\u2019t understand anything he says, and is held hostage by emotions. Complicated, but also entertaining, and this encounter with a man \u2013 who with his shock of grey hair and wire spectacles looks increasingly like a cross between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/07/ken-dodd-i-am-so-appreciative-of-what-a-fantastic-start-in-life-my-parents-gave-me\">Ken Dodd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/15/albert-einstein-genius-hidden-sides-national-geographic-drama-geoffrey-rush-emily-watson\">Albert Einstein</a> \u2013 is less a show than a chance to spend some time seeing the world through his eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bb13d3d111d3c441cd8d288db5bea30c94e479d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb13d3d111d3c441cd8d288db5bea30c94e479d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refusal to take himself too seriously \u2026 Creed on typically decisive form.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refusal to take himself too seriously \u2026 Creed on typically decisive form.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s fascinating and informative. The first picture that Creed recalls seeing was a crudely drawn image of a penis in a public toilet when he was a child. Public toilets, he thinks, are a bit like art galleries: \u201cwhite, brightly lit and full of shit\u201d. He reckons he is as much of \u201ca dick\u201d as the rest of the art world. He distrusts his own success, which is of course quite different from valuing his own work. This is the city in which people trample daily over his art as they walk up the restored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/01/edinburgh-art-festival-martin-creed\">Scotsman Steps</a> with their 104 different types of marble. It is part of their everyday lives. </p> <p>This is not your everyday sort of show, but it winds up feeling both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/26/martin-creed-interview-art-retrospective\">ordinary and extraordinary</a>. Essentially, it\u2019s watching somebody standing in front of you with a guitar and a microphone, thinking out loud and engaging you in conversation. Creed\u2019s thoughts and murmurings veer from the inconsequential to the profound as he attempts to find the perfect alignment of words and music to express how he feels. It\u2019s endearing, exposing, ticklish and so totally unassuming that it\u2019s hard to resist.

          "body": "<p>It has taken just two months of space-based experimentation for scientists and engineers to know that the European Space Agency\u2019s technology testing mission LISA Pathfinder is far exceeding its design requirements.</p> <p>The results mean that Europe could now begin building a mission to detect gravitational waves from space.<br /></p> <p>Gravitational waves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2016/feb/11/gravitational-wave-announcement-latest-physics-einstein-ligo-black-holes-live\">hit the headlines earlier this year</a> when scientists from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), based in the United States, detected these minuscule ripples for the first time. <br /></p> <p>This detection, coupled with the unprecedented success of LISA Pathfinder, led Stefano Vitale, LISA Pathfinder Primary Investigator, University of Trento to call 2016 an \u201cAnnus mirabilis\u201d at today\u2019s press conference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/mar/03/european-space-agencys-gravity-probe-leaves-uk-for-final-tests-before-launch\">European Space Agency\u2019s gravity probe leaves UK for final tests before launch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein\u2019s General Relativity. In this century-old theory, Einstein describes gravity as an invisible landscape of contours. Accelerating objects produce oscillations in this landscape, which are the gravitational waves. They propagate outwards like ripples on a pond. </p> <p>However, they are minuscule, causing disturbances of no more than a thousandth the width of an atomic nucleus. This made Einstein doubt whether they would ever be measured.</p> <p>LISA Pathfinder was supposed to take a step towards the necessary sensitivity to do this in space. However, the engineering is so good that it has virtually crossed the finish line.<br /></p> <p>At the heart of the mission are two metal cubes. Each weighs 2kg and has been hewn from a \u20ac200,000 ingot of gold-platinum alloy. Today, the European Space Agency announced that the spacecraft has succeeded in isolating these \u2018test masses\u2019 from every other force in the Universe except gravity. </p> <p>This test could not be performed on Earth because the cubes had to float freely inside the spacecraft. The position between the two cubes is measured by a laser system, which is the key to building a gravitational wave observatory in space.</p> <p>According to Fabio Favata, Head of the ESA Science Coordination Office, detecting gravitational waves is the equivalent of developing microphones for space. Until this year, all information had come from telescopes that look into the universe. </p> <p>Gravitational wave detection opens up a whole new realms to investigation. For example, colliding black holes emit no light but give out a wealth of gravitational waves. Favata said that detecting such gravitational waves was the equivalent of being in a forest and hearing the animals while not being able to see them.</p> <p>He also said that the success of the mission was only possible because of European cooperation. ESA chose Airbus in Stevenage, UK, to build the spacecraft.</p> <p>Now that LISA Pathfinder is working so well, ESA could begin building a full gravitational wave mission. This has come to be referred to generically as LISA for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). </p> <p>At the agency, the name LISA has assumed such redolence of future possibilities that ESA\u2019s Director of Science Johann-Dietrich Woerner admitted at today\u2019s press conference that he even named his first daughter after the mission.</p> <p>LISA - the mission - would detect different frequencies of gravitational waves than LIGO and other ground-based detectors. For example, from space astronomers could \u2018hear\u2019 the formation of galaxies in the early days of the Universe.</p> <p>A full LISA mission is planned for launch in 2034. It would consist of two or three identical spacecraft flying five million kilometres apart. A recent report by European experts suggested that this time frame could now be brought forward because of LISA Pathfinder\u2019s stunning success.</p> <p>But Favata warned that certain other technologies, like the laser system to communicate between the spacecraft across those millions of kilometres, needed to be developed. Once ESA was convinced that all technologies were ready, then they would green-light the mission and begin the decade-long process of building LISA.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com/\"><em>Stuart Clark</em></a><em> is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Unknown-Universe-About-Chapters/dp/1781855749/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0\"><em>The Unknown Universe</em></a><em> (Head of Zeus), and co-host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.acast.com/stuniverse\"><em>The Stuniverse</em></a><em> (Bingo Productions).</em></p>",

          "body": "<p>In accepting the degree of Doctor of Science conferred on him by the University of Manchester yesterday, Professor ALBERT EINSTEIN conferred a signal honour on Manchester and its University. The compliment was no vain one on either side, for the University of Manchester claims high distinction in the scientific field, and Professor EINSTEIN\u2019S visit is in itself a very distinct recognition of the University as a home of science. </p> <p>EINSTEIN himself has become, with amazing rapidity, the hero not only of the scientist and the scholar, but also of the populace. The reason is not hard to seek. The man in the street, a traveller between life and death, is compact of all elements, and is neither wholly devoid of science nor of poetry. He may have few ideas in either, but he probably cherishes what he has, and whatever touches them nearly is of moment to him. </p> <p>Professor EINSTEIN\u2019S theory of Relativity, however vaguely he may comprehend it, disturbs fundamentally his basic conceptions of the universe and even of his own mind. It challenges somehow the absolute nature of his thought. The very idea that he can use his mind in a disinterested way is assailed by a conception which gives partiality to every perception. And with this keen thrust at personal things, the idea of Relativity stretches out to the very conceptions of the universe, as can be seen from the mere titles of the closing chapters in Professor EINSTEIN\u2019S little book on the subject. </p> <p> Definite ideas emerge, even, on the shape of the universe itself, and the finite and the infinite are made to lie down comfortably together by deductions from the relativity of our daily observations. Everything, it has been said, assimilates to the nature of music. Professor EINSTEIN is a musician in his leisure moments, and his science seems to bear some relation to that art, in which everything is thought of in terms of movement and relation, and the fixed only as something arbitrary.<br /></p>",

          "body": "<p>Gene Sharp, an obscure American political scientist whose writing on non-violent political resistance ended up being an inspiring influence on the Arab Spring, has died peacefully at home at the age of 90.</p> <p>Sharp distilled the wisdom of icons of non-violent struggle against oppression down the ages, put his own spin on it and disseminated the philosophy around the world, most famously in his seminal work From Dictatorship to Democracy: A Conceptual Framework for Liberation. The book made waves upon publication in the early 1990s and became in effect a handbook for non-violent revolt.</p> <p>It has been translated, often by activists themselves, into dozens of languages and cited directly in many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/28/angola-jails-17-activists-rebellion-public-book-reading\">grassroots</a> uprisings and protests. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/angola-book-club-dos-santos-arrests\">Reading the revolution: the book club that terrified the Angolan regime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The retired professor believed fervently in the power of ordinary people to disempower dictators, motivating resistance leaders in the face of fear and violence with the idea that bullies ultimately could not rule if the masses withheld their support.</p> <p>His death, at his home in Boston on Sunday, was confirmed on Tuesday by Jamila Raqib, the executive director of the Albert Einstein Institution he founded in Massachusetts in 1983.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m having a lot of difficulty adequately putting into words what he meant to me and to the world. I\u2019ve been observing an outpouring at the news of Gene\u2019s passing and I think many people are reflecting on the profound effect he had on their thinking and their approaches to the massive challenges in life,\u201d Raqib told the Guardian on Tuesday.</p> <p>She said she had been looking back at Sharp\u2019s early writing from his teens and into the 1950s.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a dark world: the rise of totalitarianism, atomic weapons, the struggle against racial injustice, and he found there was not one cure, a super-solution, for oppression. He collected the wisdom of thousands of years of people fighting oppression,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Raqib said Sharp was less an activist than an intellectual and an advocate. But his passion in empowering the grassroots with the belief that people could rebel successfully using non-violent means enraged dictators from Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and authorities from Russia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/angola-book-club-dos-santos-arrests\">Angola</a>.

He never won it but received many other prizes and awards for his work.</p> <p>The British journalist and film-maker Ruaridh Arrow, who made a documentary about Sharp and the drive behind Dictatorship to Democracy in 2012, said Sharp was painfully aware that resistance could cost lives.</p> <p>\u201cYou will sustain casualties, but fewer casualties than if you resort to violence. And non-violent action can make the transition to democracy easier. Sharp examined the models and strategies of titans of non-violence and basically put it in a manual,\u201d Arrow told the Guardian.</p> <p>Arrow\u2019s documentary about Sharp, How to Start a Revolution, was about to be released when the Arab Spring, the series of popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/23/arab-spring-five-years-on-writers-look-back\">uprisings</a> across parts of north Africa and the Middle East that began in Tunisia in 2011, took place. </p> <p>Arrow recently completed Sharp\u2019s authorized biography, which is due to be published in the US and the UK some time this spring.</p> <p>He said that Sharp admired icons such as Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King Jr and many others but he did not so much argue for the moral values of non-violent resistance as the sheer pragmatism and effectiveness of it. Sharp argued that that could mean the masses all staying at home, refusing to participate in a society\u2019s everyday functioning.</p> <p>Sharp served time in prison for civil disobedience. He refused to carry his draft card and submit to conscription to fight in the Korean war. He was born in Ohio and studied at Ohio State and Oxford universities, later becoming a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Sharp\u2019s first book, Gandhi Wields the Weapon of Modern Power: Three Case Histories, was published in 1960.</p>",

In new research, scientists report signature patterns of neural activity that mark out those who are most creative.</p> <p>\u201cWe have identified a pattern of brain connectivity that varies across people, but is associated with the ability to come up with creative ideas,\u201d said Roger Beaty, a psychologist at Harvard University. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can predict with perfect accuracy who\u2019s going to be the next Einstein, but we can get a pretty good sense of how flexible a given person\u2019s thinking is.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/07/thinking-caps-on-electrical-currents-boost-creative-problem-solving-study-finds\">Suppressing the reasoning part of the brain stimulates creativity, scientists find</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Creative thinking is one of the primary drivers of cultural and technological change, but the brain activity that underpins original thought has been hard to pin down. In an effort to shed light on the creative process, Beaty teamed up with colleagues in Austria and China to scan people\u2019s brains as they came up with original ideas.<br /></p> <p>The scientists asked the volunteers to perform a creative thinking task as they lay inside a brain scanner. While the machine recorded their white matter at work, the participants had 12 seconds to come up with the most imaginative use for an object that flashed up on a screen. Three independent scorers then rated their answers.<br /></p> <p>One of the barriers to creative thinking is the ease with which common, unoriginal thoughts swamp the mind. Some people in the study could not get past these. For example, when asked for creative uses for a sock, soap and chewing gum wrapper, less creative people gave answers such as \u201ccovering the feet\u201d, \u201cmaking bubbles\u201d and \u201ccontaining gum\u201d respectively. For the same items, more original thinkers suggested a water filtration system, a seal for envelopes, and an antenna wire.</p> <p>Reported in the <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1713532115\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, the study found distinct patterns of brain activity in the most and least creative people. In the highly original thinkers, the scientists saw strong connectivity between three networks of the brain. One, known as the default mode network, is linked to spontaneous thinking and mind wandering, while a second, the executive control network, is engaged when people focus in on their thoughts. The third, called the salience network, helps to work out what best deserves our attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/20/how-brain-freestyles-music\">Making it up as you go along: how your brain improvises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first two of these three brain networks tend to work against one another, Beaty said, each dampening the other down. But the scans suggest that more creative people can better engage both networks at once. \u201cIt might be easier for creative thinkers to bring these resources to bear simultaneously,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Initial scans on men and women from the University of North Carolina were backed up by further scans in Austrian and Chinese volunteers. To make sure enough creative people took part in the study, the researchers recruited plenty of artists, musicians and scientists. Now, Beaty wants to look at brain activity in different creative pursuits, such as the arts and sciences, and investigate whether training helps boost creative powers.</p> <p>In 2016, David Melcher, who studies creativity at the University of Trento, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39185\">identified brain networks used in visual art</a>. \u201cA critical open question, for future research, is whether this ability to put the brain in creative mode transfers across tasks,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we learn to network our brain regions for creativity in new domains once we learn to do it, for example, in painting or freestyle rap?\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cThere has been an educational policy, in many countries including the US, of reducing teaching hours in the arts and focusing instead on rote learning for yearly testing of basic knowledge,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to understand whether creativity is a transferable skill, a way of using the brain that students learn to use across fields.\u201d<br /></p>",

When massive objects merge, this curvature can be altered, sending ripples out across the universe. These are known as gravitational waves.By the time these disturbances reach us, they are almost imperceptible. It was only a century after Einstein's prediction that scientists developed a detector sensitive enough - the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory or Ligo - and were able to confirm the existence of gravitational waves.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The direct detection of gravitational waves also opens a new vista on the \u201cdark\u201d side of the cosmos, to times and places from which no optical light escapes. This includes just fractions of a second after the Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago, when scientists believe gravitational waves left a permanent imprint on the cosmos that may still be perceptible today.</p> \n<p>Speaking at a press conference after the announcement, Weiss, an emeritus professor of physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the 2015 detection was the culmination of decades of work, involving more than 1,000 scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s as long as 40 years of people thinking about this, trying to make a detections, sometimes failing \u2026 and then slowly but surely getting the technology together to be able do it,\u201d he said, adding that receiving the phone call from the Nobel committee had been \u201creally wonderful\u201d.</p> \n<p>The notion that spacetime is malleable was first predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. But Einstein himself was unsure whether this was merely a mathematical illusion, and concluded that, in any case, the signal would be so tiny that it would \u201cnever play a role in science\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was a significant career gamble then, when in the mid-1970s Weiss and Thorne, who is now the Feynman professor of theoretical physics at California Institute of Technology, began on the decades-long quest to detect gravitational waves, which they believed could revolutionise our understanding of the universe.</p> \n<p>Weiss designed a detector, called a laser-based inferometer, that he believed would be capable of measuring a signal so tiny that it could easily be masked by the background murmur of the ocean waves. Thorne, a theorist, began making crucial predictions of what the signal of a gravitational wave emanating from two black holes colliding would actually look like.</p> \n<p>Independently, Ronald Drever, a Scottish physicist, also began building prototype detectors in Glasgow and after moving to Caltech, he, Weiss and Thorne formed a trio that laid the groundwork for Ligo. Drever died in March after suffering from dementia, and while the Nobel prize is not normally awarded posthumously, he is widely recognised as having made a decisive contribution.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/will-nobel-prize-overlook-master-builder-gravitational-wave-detectors\">Barry Barish</a>, a former particle physicist at California Institute of Technology (now emeritus professor) came to the project at a much later stage, but is often credited for making Ligo happen. When he took over as its second director in 1994, the project was at risk of being cancelled.

At the start of the 20 millisecond \u201cchirp\u201d in the signal, the two objects were found to be circling each other 30 times a second. By the end, the rate had accelerated to 250 times a second before meeting in a violent collision.<br></p> \n<p>Since then, three further black hole collisions have been made and rumours are afoot that the consortium may have also observed the collision of a pair of neutron stars. In the future, scientists hope to supernovae, pulsars and the insides of stars as they collapse into black holes. A network of gravitational-wave observatories could even allow us to gaze back to almost the beginning of time itself.</p> \n<p>Thorne said: \u201cThe prize rightfully belongs to the hundreds of Ligo scientists and engineers who built and perfected our complex gravitational-wave interferometers, and the hundreds of \u2026 scientists who found the gravitational-wave signals in Ligo\u2019s noisy data and extracted the waves\u2019 information.\u201d</p> \n<p>Barish said he was humbled and honoured to receive the award. \u201cThe detection of gravitational waves is truly a triumph of modern large-scale experimental physics,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Sheila Rowan, director of the Institute for Gravitational Research at the University of Glasgow, said: \u201cWe are really on the threshold of a whole new way to study our universe and that\u2019s hugely exciting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Paul Hardaker, chief executive officer of the Institute of Physics, said: \u201cFor as long as we have had astronomy we have used light in some form or another to understand how our universe works. This significant result marked the beginning of another way of viewing the universe, using gravity, which is what makes it such a major step forward, and so deserving of a Nobel prize.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sir Martin Rees, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Cambridge, and the Astronomer Royal, said this year\u2019s laureates are \u201coutstanding individuals and whose contributions were distinctive and complementary\u201d. However, he said the decision to award individuals rather than collaborations was increasingly problematic, and did not reflect the nature of modern science.<br></p> \n<p>Last year\u2019s prize went to three British physicists for their work on exotic states of matter that may pave the way for quantum computers and other revolutionary technologies.</p> \n<p>On Monday, three American scientists shared the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/02/nobel-prize-for-medicine-awarded-for-insights-into-internal-biological-clock\">2017 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine</a> for their painstaking work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/02/nobel-prizes-2017-everything-you-need-to-know-about-circadian-rhythms\">circadian rhythms</a>.

The two combined to form a single black hole with a mass slightly less than 49 times that of the sun and the leftover energy spilled out as deformations that spread outwards across spacetime like ripples across a pond.</p> <p>Ligo scientists made the first historic observation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">gravitational waves</a> in September 2015, using a pair of 4km-long perpendicular pipes, one in Hanford, Washington state, the other in Livingston, Louisiana.

We\u2019re really interested in doing a new type of astronomy.\u201d</p> <p>The detectors are sensitive enough to pick up distortions as tiny as one thousandth of the diameter of a proton in laser beams sent down Ligo\u2019s tubes, and can even crudely recreate the dynamics of the collisions.</p> <p>The astronomers believe their latest finding \u201cprovides clues about the directions in which the black holes are spinning\u201d. As pairs of black holes spiral inwards, heading towards a collision, they also spin on their own axes. The latest observations hint that these spins are misaligned. This could indicate that the pair of black holes formed not from a binary star system, but from two independent black holes that randomly came together in a dense primordial star cluster.</p> <h2>Black holes and dark matter</h2> <p>Intriguingly, the observations are consistent with one of the more exotic explanations for the nature of dark matter \u2013 that dark matter haloes observed around galaxies are made up of a smattering of small black holes.</p> <p>The theory would require these black holes to have been formed in the early universe, from patches of material\u2013 rather than stars \u2013 collapsing inwards. The latest observations reveal the existence of black holes in a \u201cmass window\u201d that would be consistent with this theory. However, the theory is still viewed as \u201ca little exotic\u201d, according to Berry.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4gjbp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2454865\"            data-video-name=\"Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56bcb63fe4b0d007e4723bec\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\">Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The study once again puts Albert Einstein\u2019s theories to the test.

You can choose from Einstein, Tesla, Pythagoras, Hawking, Turing, Darwin, Newton and Curie (it would have been nice to see more female scientists on the roster), and each comes with their own set of science-based power-ups. Stephen Hawking can create black holes to inflict damage on your opponent, while Curie harnesses the power of radium-coated hands to unleash a fireball reminiscent of Ryu\u2019s Hadouken.</p> <p>Aside from signature moves, you have basic weak and strong attacks \u2013 Newton is pretty brutal in this department, brandishing a telescope to lamp opponents over the head with. If you don\u2019t have time to play, Diego Sanches, the animator for the game, has a gallery of all of the moves as GIFs <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/34335649/science-combat\">here</a>.</p> <p>Gameplay is pretty basic, but there are some nice little surprises in the game \u2013 not least the end boss in tournament mode. According to the website, the game is also going to be ported to mobile platforms \u2013 so there\u2019s still an opportunity for the roster to be rounded out a little more.

The only downside is that scientists have yet to find any experimental proof that it is right \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/oct/08/research.highereducation\">critics question</a> whether its predictions are even testable. </p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/06/048/\">a new paper</a> has claimed that gravitational wave measurements could hold the key to whether string theory is destined to fulfil its lofty goals or be consigned to the dustbin of discarded ideas. The study suggests that the first observable evidence for the existence of extra dimensions, one of string theory\u2019s predictions, could be hidden within the ripples of gravitational waves.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be amazing because general relativity and Einstein do not predict this at all,\u201d said David Andriot, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam and co-author of the study.</p> <p>The crux of string theory \u2013 although there are many competing versions \u2013 is that all particles can be viewed as one-dimensional strings on which the fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism and so on) act as different modes of vibration. For reasons better explained in maths than words, the framework also requires there to be at least six extra spatial dimensions, in addition to time and the three spatial ones of everyday life. </p> <p>Scientists, notably those working at the Large Hadron Collider, have looked for energy vanishing into these hypothetical extra dimensions, but so far efforts have been inconclusive. One possibility is that the dimensions are coiled up so tightly that they are imperceptible; another is that they are not there at all.</p> <p>Andriot is hopeful that the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) experiment could start to answer this question. </p> <p>In 2015, Ligo made the historic first observation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">gravitational waves</a>, the compression and stretching of space that Einstein predicted would occur as a mass moves through the fabric of the universe. In this case, Ligo\u2019s detectors were picking up the ripples sent out across space-time following the violent collision of a pair of black holes more than a billion years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f01871f96627a4114c8bfae39242cce987f1cc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f01871f96627a4114c8bfae39242cce987f1cc5/97_168_1906_1143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) technician inspects the twin detectors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) technician inspects the device\u2019s twin detectors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LIGO Laboratory/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>String theory predicts that, during such cataclysmic events, ripples should also be travelling through the extra spatial dimensions and that there should be subtle interactions between the standard waves and those hidden from view.</p> <p>\u201cOur study concludes that if there are extra dimensions it would lead to another mode of shrinking and stretching,\u201d said Andriot.</p> <p>The latest paper, published in the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2017/06/048/meta\">Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics</a>, concludes this would produce a \u201cbreathing\u201d effect, superimposed on the main gravitational wave. The pattern might be measurable once a third detector, called Virgo, joins the twin Ligo detectors in gathering data late next year or early in 2019, although the team have not yet worked out whether the effect would be big enough to spot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\">Gravitational waves: breakthrough discovery after a century of expectation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we have extra dimensions we can get this effect, but there are other things that could cause it. It\u2019s not a smoking gun for extra dimensions,\u201d said Andriot.</p> <p>Christopher Berry, a scientist working on Ligo at the University of Birmingham, said it is a priority to look for the kinds of subtle modifications to gravitational waves described in the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the classic tests that we would like to do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Such observations would be hugely significant because they are not predicted by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, meaning that our understanding of how gravity behaves would need to be revised. One option is string theory, but there are other competing theories. The absence of the \u201cbreathing\u201d effect would help rule out some of these theories, or narrow the window in which they could occur.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect that any deviations from general relativity would happen in the most extreme conditions \u2013 that\u2019s where you\u2019d expect the theory would break,\u201d said Berry. \u201cThe best place for testing that is the collision of black holes.\u201d</p> <p>The paper also predicts that gravitational waves should ripple through each extra dimension at a characteristic frequency \u2013 analogous to the way organ pipes of different lengths produce notes of different pitch. Working on the assumption that the extra dimensions are very small, a series of higher-frequency gravitational waves would be predicted. These would be at a frequency more than a billion times higher than the limit of what Ligo could detect, but which might be observable one day by a future detector.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was seen, we could talk of a smoking gun,\u201d said Andriot. </p> <p>Others remain unconvinced that such observations would provide the sought-after experimental proof. Peter Woit, a theoretical physicist at Columbia University, New York, and longstanding critic of string theory, said: \u201cThe problem is that string theory says nothing at all about the sizes of these extra dimensions, they could be anything from infinitely large to infinitely small, so there\u2019s no real prediction. If we ever do see extra dimensions, there\u2019s no particular reason to believe these have anything to do with string theory.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 July 2017.

In March 2016, a 26-year-old British man, Ben Innes, a passenger on an EgyptAir flight, managed to persuade the plane\u2019s hijacker, Seif Eldin Mustafa, to pose with him for a selfie. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/30/briton-ben-innes-posed-selfie-egyptair-hijacker-praised-by-relatives\" title=\"\">In the photo</a>, Mustafa is wearing what appears to be an explosives vest (though it was later found to be fake).</p> <p>If the internet has radically altered the way we think, the smartphone is simultaneously altering the way we look \u2013 and are looked at \u2013 in ways that would have seemed unimaginable a few decades ago. As both these examples illustrate, our behaviour has changed accordingly: we seem to have become less self-conscious and self-aware. Thus, posing for selfies, snapping total strangers and filming almost everything we do, from eating lunch to attending a concert, has become so commonplace as to be rarely commented on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One section contrasts the ways in which animals and humans became exotic spectacles for western audiences in the 1800s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Written by film-maker, critic and one-time television presenter Mark Cousins, <em>The Story of Looking</em> is certainly timely. It roams freely across history, art, film, photography, science and technology. His journey into looking begins with him imagining\u00a0how an early Homo sapiens\u2019 baby might have seen the world \u2013 as a \u201csoft-edged\u201d and \u201cimmaterial\u201d shadowland \u2013 and ends, more than 400 pages later, with a meditation on G\u00e9ricault\u2019s still shocking painting, <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/119264\" title=\"\"><em>Head of a Guillotined Man</em></a>. In between those two well-chosen reference points \u2013 the birth of human looking and the unflinching gaze of an artist \u2013 Cousins covers so much disparate ground that it is sometimes hard to see the wood for the trees.</p> <p>He is illuminating on the various ways artists and film-makers look at the world, but his style, a kind of thematic free association, made me long for the conciseness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/06/john-berger-remembered-by-geoff-dyer-olivia-laing-and-ali-smith\" title=\"\">John Berger</a> in his game-changing book, <em>Ways of Seeing</em>. A section entitled Atomic Looking shifts in the space of 10 pages from Luis Bu\u00f1uel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/22/satyajit-ray-artifice-honesty-film\" title=\"\">Satyajit Ray</a>, by way of Albert Einstein, Piero della Francesca, John Sayles, Max Planck and Van Gogh. The effect is dazzling, but disorienting, not least because the images referred to, whether still or moving, often require a degree of patience, attentiveness and slow looking from the viewer. Unlike Berger, Cousins does not have an ideological axe to grind so his book often reads like a primer for art and media studies students.</p> <p>For all that, there is much that is surprising here, not least in Cousins\u2019s remarkable ability to make you look again at the act of looking, often through arresting juxtapositions. A section entitled Zoos and Morgues contrasts the ways in which animals and humans became exotic spectacles for western audiences in the early 1800s. In one photograph, a row of well-dressed men\u00a0in shiny shoes stare at a reconstruction of a Sudanese village featuring actual Nubian men, women and children. \u201cDid they make eye contact, even for a moment?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd if so, what did each side think? Did the polished shoe people feel ashamed? Probably not, because the ideas of the time led them to believe that others should be available for their inspection.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/20/mark-cousins-children-film-cannes\">Mark Cousins: the kids stay in the picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unsurprisingly, Cousins is incisive about cinematic ways of looking, beginning with the notorious moment in Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s 1929 film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1146569,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>Un Chien Andalou</em></a>, in which a razor blade apparently slices a young woman\u2019s eyeball. The scene, he writes, \u201ccan be taken as a metaphor for the violent increase in looking and imaging\u201d in the 20th century. It could also be read as a metaphor for the ways in which deep looking has been assailed by the unprecedented profligacy of 21st-century image culture. We are besieged by photographs that often drift unmoored from their contexts and\u00a0no amount of looking can account for their banality. One could go as far as\u00a0to say that we are being blinded by the sheer ubiquity of often banal images in the age of Facebook and the selfie. Cousins disagrees, arguing that \u201cit is too easy to overlook how liberating and affirming the effects of the\u00a0former can be\u201d, and \u201cselfies are mainly a sign of how fascinated we are with seeing ourselves in groups and in the world\u201d. No mention of the downside: our increasingly narcissistic culture or the blaming and bullying that also infects social media.</p> <p>For students of art and film, <em>The Story of Looking</em> may well prove indispensable as a reference book, but it seems a rather well-mannered and all too forgiving response to the turbulent times we live in.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Story of Looking </em>by Mark Cousins is published by Canongate (\u00a325).

          "body": "<p>The war raging in Rocinha, Latin America\u2019s largest favela, has already been lost. Rooted in a dispute between gangs for control of drug trafficking, it has disrupted the daily life of the community in Rio de Janeiro since mid-September. With the sound of shots coming from all sides, schools and shops are constantly forced to close. Recently, a stray bullet killed a Spanish tourist. The war is not the only thing being lost.<br /></p> <p> For decades, Brazil has had the same drug policy approach. Police, weapons and numerous arrests. It does not take an expert to conclude the obvious: the strategy has failed. Drug trafficking and consumption have only increased. Einstein is credited with a saying \u2013 though apparently it is not his \u2013 that applies well to the case: insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c16a612207e8e48559fdceae3d4ab319d38f94b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c16a612207e8e48559fdceae3d4ab319d38f94b5/756_0_3038_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cThe insanity of Brazil\u2019s drug policy is striking\u2019: Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apu Gomes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In a case still before the Brazilian supreme court, I voted for decriminalising the possession of marijuana for private consumption. The case has been suspended and no date has been set for its resumption. I also proposed to open a broad debate on the legalisation of marijuana, to begin with \u2013 and then, if successful, cocaine. The subject is extremely delicate, and the outcome hinges on a decision from the legislature. </p> <p>Drugs are an issue that has a profound impact on the criminal justice system, and it is legitimate for the supreme court to participate in the public debate. So here are the reasons for my views.</p> <p>First, drugs are bad and it is therefore the role of the state and society to discourage consumption, treat dependents and repress trafficking. The rationale behind legalisation is rooted in the belief that it will help in achieving these goals. </p> <p>Second, the war on drugs has failed. Since the 1970s, under the influence and leadership of the US, the world has tackled this problem with the use of police forces, armies, and armaments. The tragic reality is that 40 years, billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of prisoners and thousands of deaths later, things are worse. At least in countries like Brazil. </p> <p>Third, as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLsCC0LZxkY\">American economist Milton Friedman argued</a>, the only result of criminalisation is ensuring the trafficker\u2019s monopoly.</p> <p> With these points in mind, what would legalisation achieve? </p> <p>In most countries in North America and Europe, the greatest concern of the authorities is users and the impact drugs have on their lives and on society. These are all important considerations. In Brazil, however, the principal focus must be ending the dominance drug dealers exercise over poor communities. Gangs have become the main political and economic power in thousands of modest neighbourhoods in Brazil. This scenario prevents a family of honest and hard-working people from educating their children away from the influence of criminal factions, who intimidate, co-opt and exercise an unfair advantage over any lawful activity. Crucially, this power of trafficking comes from illegality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/19/rio-voices-view-from-the-favelas-we-hit-rock-bottom-financially-and-socially\">View from the Rio favelas: 'We hit rock bottom, financially and socially' | Michel Silva</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Another benefit of legalisation would be to prevent the mass incarceration of impoverished young people with no criminal record who are arrested for trafficking because they are caught in possession of negligible amounts of marijuana. A third of detainees in Brazil are imprisoned for drug trafficking. Once arrested, young prisoners will have to join one of the factions that control the penitentiaries \u2013 and on that day, they become dangerous. </p> <p>Moreover, each place in prison costs 40,000 reais (\u00a39,174) to create and 2,000 reais a month to maintain. Worse still, within a day of one man being arrested, another is recruited from the reserve army that exists in poor communities.</p> <p> The insanity of this policy is striking: it destroys lives, generates worse outcomes for society, is expensive, and has no impact on drug trafficking. Only superstition, prejudice or ignorance could make someone think this is effective. </p> <p> For these reasons, I believe we should consider alternative means of combating drugs, not least better planning, expert engagement and greater attention to the experiences of other countries. We should consider the possibility of dealing with marijuana as we deal with cigarettes: a licit product, regulated, sold in certain places, taxed, and subject to age and advertisement restrictions, warning notices and campaigns discouraging consumption. In the past two decades, cigarette consumption in Brazil has more than halved; fighting in the light of day, with ideas and information, has brought better results.</p> <p> We cannot be certain that a progressive and cautious policy of decriminalisation and legalisation will be successful. What we can affirm is that the existing policy of criminalisation has failed. We must take chances; otherwise, we risk simply accepting a terrible situation. As the Brazilian navigator Amyr Klink said: \u201cThe worst shipwreck is not setting off at all.\u201d</p> <p></p>",

Music is sidelined too, as are languages. Children are removed from French lessons for extra reading and writing interventions; school productions are shelved due to lack of practice time; opportunities for drama are reduced to the odd English lesson. </p> <p>I get why it\u2019s happening. Teachers are under pressure to improve outcomes for reading, writing and maths, particularly in year groups where Sats are the only tool for assessing children. I\u2019ve been in that position myself, forced to make changes to timetables I\u2019d rather not. Before I became a primary modern languages teacher I taught year 6. Every January I would sit down with my colleagues and take a red pen to the timetable I\u2019d carefully crafted in September, replacing music with extra comprehension or swapping French for additional spelling sessions. </p> <p>In a recent NEU (then the NUT) survey, 97% of the union\u2019s teachers agreed that Sats preparation did not support <a href=\"https://www.teachers.org.uk/education-policies/primary/crisis-in-primary-assessment\">children\u2019s access to a broad and balanced curriculum</a>, saying the time taken to prepare children for assessment in maths and English has squeezed out other subjects and activities. The problem doesn\u2019t stop when our children leave primary. The proportion of 15- and 16-year-olds taking subjects like music and drama has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/21/proportion-of-students-taking-arts-subjects-falls-to-lowest-level-in-decade\">fallen to its lowest level in 10 years</a>. The study of modern foreign languages at GCSE is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/fall-in-number-of-students-taking-modern-foreign-languages-brexit-british-council-prompts-concerns-a7877491.html\">also in decline</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worry about the message we\u2019re sending our children when we push arts and languages into the background</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I feel strongly that our schools are missing a trick. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/03/school-results-music-bradford\">Feversham Primary in Bradford recently made headlines</a> for its focus on teaching the arts, particularly music, which has led to improved pupil outcomes. The fact that the school\u2019s approach has made the national newspapers is enough to tell us it\u2019s unusual. The problem is that adopting a revolutionary approach such as this is a risk that, facing budget cuts and Ofsted scrutiny, most headteachers are not willing to take.</p> <p>Improving outcomes aside, I worry about the message we\u2019re sending our children when we push arts and languages into the background. I worry we\u2019re creating a gulf between children whose parents can afford to take them to private music lessons, language clubs or the theatre, and those whose access comes mainly through the school curriculum. </p> <p>But more than all this, I\u2019m reminded of an Einstein quote \u2013 the one that says that if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will spend its life thinking it is stupid. There are children who struggle to read but come to life on the stage. There are those who just can\u2019t concentrate in other lessons but will sit and paint for an hour without leaving their seat. If our schools are only interested in children\u2019s progress and attainment in a limited range of subjects, how can we ever hope to build on the potential of those whose strengths lie elsewhere?</p> <p>The trouble is that creativity, increased confidence or a love of the arts aren\u2019t easily measured through standardised tests, data analysis or league tables. Maybe that\u2019s why, ultimately, certain subjects are sidelined. Perhaps I\u2019m idealistic, but this is an issue that bothers me. It should bother my school leadership and government too. </p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuardianTeacherNetwork/\">Facebook</a>, and join the <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/agree/GTNF?returnUrl=https://teachers.theguardian.com/Registration.aspx\">Guardian Teacher Network</a> the latest articles direct to your inbox</strong><br /></p> <p><strong>Looking for a teaching job?

Ask \u201cHow could you do this?\u201d \u201cHave you done anything similar before?\u201d \u201cWhat did you do then?\u201d This helps them develop their own learning ideas and makes them much less likely to say they can\u2019t do things.<br />\u2022 Build big picture thinking.

How can you tell whether you are doing it right?\u201d This one is the key to maximising thinking skills.</p> <p><strong>Behave right </strong><br />\u2022 Intellectual confidence. This is a \u201ccan do\u201d approach to learning, even when it\u2019s hard. If a child says they are no good at something, say: \u201cI know you can. I know it\u2019s hard to do now but I know you can learn how to do this in time if you work at it.\u201d<br />\u2022 Open mindedness. Being open to new ideas is the hallmark of an advanced learner. Start with being open minded yourself so you model what it\u2019s like to be receptive to ideas that differ from your own. <br />\u2022 Curiosity. Children ask lots of questions if you answer them, though the number falls dramatically once they get to school and only the class teacher is there to answer. The desire to know more \u2013 curiosity \u2013 is at the heart of all learning. High performance is fuelled by it. The more curious children are, the more whys and hows they ask, the better they do at school and in life.<br />\u2022 Practice. It\u2019s the only way to get good at something. Make sure it is regular, deliberate and planned, working towards achievable incremental goals, and that you practise what you can\u2019t do well.<br />\u2022 Perseverance. To keep going when it\u2019s tough is the most important behaviour in high performance. Model it yourself. With younger children you can talk about what would happen if no one persevered \u2013 the farmer who didn\u2019t bother to harvest his crops, the builder to finish the house, the \u00adsurgeon to complete the operation.

While variation in parasites has precluded to this day an effective vaccine against all strains of malaria, Sydney was one of the first to show that successful vaccination was possible, using forms of the parasite that live in the blood.</p> <p>In recognition of his work, Sydney was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and was appointed CBE in 1978. He was a member of the Medical Research Council and chairman of its Tropical Medicine Research Board (1974-76).</p> <p>He was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the last of four children of Pauline (nee Soloveychik) and Morris Cohen, Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. His grandfather, Shmuel, had opened a wholesale grocery in downtown Johannesburg. Sydney completed a medical degree at the University of the Witwatersrand, before sailing to Britain on SS Nestor, arriving 10 days after the end of the second world war in Europe. At the Royal Berkshire hospital, in Reading, he treated the war injured \u2013 and was astounded to see a white woman on her hands and knees cleaning the floor.</p> <p>The ensuing decade was spent moving back and forth between Britain and South Africa, where Sydney\u2019s last post was as dean of the one remaining residence for black students at Wits. He repeatedly had to extricate his talented black students from unjustified arrest by the police force. By the time the student house was finally shut down in 1963 under the tightening grip of apartheid, Sydney had emigrated, disgusted by the waste of South Africa\u2019s human potential.</p> <p>In London, Sydney worked at the National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill, north London, and then at St Mary\u2019s hospital, Paddington, where his talents as an immunologist were recognised by Rodney Porter, who would win the Nobel prize for medicine in 1972 for determining the chemical structure of an antibody. From 1965 until his retirement in 1986, he was professor of chemical pathology at Guy\u2019s hospital, and he was chair from 1976 to 1981 of the World Health Organisation\u2019s steering committee on the immunology of malaria.</p> <p>Sydney enjoyed painting, gardening, carpentry and golf. He had a marvellously deadpan sense of humour. When a South African relative suggested he change his name, because Cohen was too conspicuously Jewish to make it in Britain, he said that was a wonderful idea \u2013 and suggested Einstein, instead.</p> <p>In 1950 he married June Adler, a magistrate whom he met at a tennis party at her grandfather\u2019s house in Johannesburg. June died in 1999. That year he married Deirdre Boyd, who had assisted him at Guy\u2019s, and<strong> </strong>later<strong> </strong>they moved to St Andrews, on Scotland\u2019s east coast, where he was a member of the Royal and Ancient golf club.</p> <p>Deirdre survives him, as do his children from his first marriage, me and my sister, Jenny, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</p>",

What\u2019s less familiar is scientists demonstrating, thousands of them around the world, with placards and banners declaring \u201cScience improves decisions\u201d and other inflammatory assertions, such as \u201cScience belongs to no country because knowledge belongs to humanity\u201d. \u201cEvidence not arrogance,\u201d they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/22/evidence-not-arrogance-uk-supporters-join-global-march-for-science\">demanded</a>.</p> <p>But you don\u2019t have to be anti-science to see that there is an inevitability about its difficult relationship with politics. It is the point where knowledge and belief collide, which is why it is now the crucible of the culture wars.</p> <p>Scientists can\u2019t but be the villains of the Brexit narrative. They are highly educated in the ultimate transferrable skills. They are the quintessential citizens of the world, people who keep their passports in their back pockets, and often work not just in towns where they were not born but in countries their parents never imagined visiting. They might dream of a Nobel prize, but they may also have an eye on a job in Silicon Valley. Intellectual property is the new alchemy.</p> <p>More challenging than their lifestyles, however, is their insistence on the sanctity of evidence and the importance of making decisions based on established fact. Expert-deniers trade on the natural resistance to uncomfortable truth by asserting that the truth is a negotiable quality. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2099977-what-donald-trump-has-said-about-science-and-why-hes-wrong/\">thinks</a> windfarms are bad for your health, and low-energy lightbulbs give you cancer. He has linked childhood immunisation with autism. Although he tweeted yesterday that \u201crigorous science is critical to my administration\u201d, he has yet to appoint a scientific policy adviser.</p> <p>In one way, this is an argument that was already well rehearsed when Pope Paul V took on Galileo 400 years ago. Science and belief have always rubbed up against each other. They find compromise positions. Popes die. In the end, science emerges victorious.</p> <p>Yet there are differences. Trump is not arguing from some alternative, God-centred perspective. He is not defending a belief system subscribed to by most of the known world. He just doesn\u2019t like facts that contradict what he wants to say. The expert-deniers rest their case on experts sometimes being wrong. They refuse to recognise that to know something properly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\">it must be capable of being proved wrong</a>. If it is, that in fact constitutes the advancement of knowledge.</p> <p>There is another reason science is at the heart of this argument. Scientists are all very well when they are discovering penicillin and working out how to transfer great quantities of data instantaneously. Science is good when it makes life longer, easier, richer and more comfortable and convenient. It is also wonderful when it is makes discoveries concerning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/sweet-naked-mole-rats-can-survive-without-oxygen-using-plant-sugar-tactic-fructose\">metabolism of naked mole rats</a>, or <a href=\"http://newatlas.com/negative-mass-fluid/49040/\">negative-mass fluids</a> \u2013 mind-boggling discoveries that are basically irrelevant to most people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>It is a harder sell when it points to unacceptable realities. It\u2019s disagreeable to stop smoking or to drink less alcohol or to avoid sugary drinks. The people who make cigarettes, booze and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/22/bathtub-of-sugary-drinks-a-year-cancer-warning-over-teenage-intake\">fizzy drinks</a> are often unscrupulous in defence of their products and their profits. Accepting that our way of life threatens the sustainability of the planet was never going to be easy. Donald Trump is not a new version of a 17th-century pope, but there are millions of US voters who believe he can preserve their world: a world that depends on coal and cars.</p> <p>There was plenty to admire about the scientists\u2019 protest. But it\u2019s increasingly clear that their greatest skill \u2013 unearthing the truth \u2013 is not enough to win a culture war.</p>",

Cambridge will also be trying to persuade all its former academics, who include 98 Nobel prize winners, to follow Hawking\u2019s example.</p> <p>The university library has 8m books and periodicals, and a million maps, on 125 miles of shelving expanding by two miles every year.</p> <p>The treasures in the Apollo archive, which together have been downloaded a million times from all over the world in 2017, include 15,000 research articles, 10,000 images and 2,400 theses. However, the university says it is often a struggle to give free access to historic theses.</p> <p>Arthur Smith, deputy head of scholarly communication, said more open-access research could lead to major breakthroughs. He said: \u201cBy eliminating the barriers between people and knowledge we can realise new breakthroughs in all areas of science, medicine and technology. </p> <p>\u201cIt is especially important for disseminating the knowledge acquired during doctoral research studies. PhD theses contain a vast trove of untapped and unique information just waiting to be used, but which is often locked away from view and scrutiny.\u201d</p> <p>Hawking, whose original medical diagnosis more than half a century ago gave him two years to live, continues to work and and lecture internationally.

          "body": "<p>What a miraculous thing art is. Just when you thought you knew what it was, it becomes something else. Perhaps transformation itself is the essence of art \u2013 or perhaps it has no essence at all, but is simply a name we give to whatever heightens life and reveals its beauty. Apologies for these wandering thoughts but the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/susan-philipsz\">Susan Philipsz</a> induces contemplation and reverie, provoking the mind as it enthrals the soul.</p> <p>A Single Voice is her most obviously art-like work of art yet, in that it gives you a film to look at. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/06/turner-prize-winner-susan-philipsz\">Philipsz won the 2010 Turner prize</a> with a room that was empty except for sound, and her work is primarily aural, even if her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/20/susan-philipsz-war-damaged-musical-instruments-review-tate-britain\">recent Tate Britain installation</a> remembering the first world war did feature a collection of battered musical instruments. </p> <p>At Baltic she shows her film of violinist Leila Akhmetova playing, and waiting to play, alone in a studio. A camera mounted on a circular dolly track pans endlessly and restlessly around Akhmetova, closing in as she studies the score on a computer screen, panning away to see her sitting upright playing a prolonged note. It is a compelling, hypnotic study of an orchestral musician taken out of the orchestra, playing alone with strange dignity and wondrous discipline, as the camera silently watches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"659c54b3adb2e3d879c4ed78eb74963457ee057c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/659c54b3adb2e3d879c4ed78eb74963457ee057c/0_70_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen showing violinist Leila Akhmetova in the middle of a hall of speakers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The film Philipsz has made is alluring... yet it is perhaps not the real artwork at all.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image c/o the artist and Baltic Mill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There I go again \u2013 feasting on the visual. A nice motion picture to look at. The film Philipsz has made is alluring, projected on a huge screen in a vast darkened hangar of a space. Yet it is perhaps not the real artwork at all. The heart of her installation is the sound that moves between isolated speakers placed along two sides of the long, post-industrial gallery. As Akhmetova waits to play her part, rich or shrill string notes are heard from different parts of the shadowy cavernous gallery. Then she raises her bow, and as she brings it down you recognise her note streaming from her speaker.</p> <p>As the sound builds up, you are drawn from speaker to speaker, pacing around the installation even as the camera pans around the violinist. The film can be watched from both sides of the screen, making it even more entrancing to move through a space that starts to feel increasingly solid and substantial as it fills, bit by bit, with sound.</p> <p>Science has recently entered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/27/new-gravitational-wave-detection-shows-shape-of-ripples-from-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo\">the age of gravitational waves</a>, as the latest astrophysics proves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Einstein</a>\u2019s century-old theory of space-time. Philipsz too is Einsteinian, it strikes me, as the air vibrates to lonely notes. Sound is a wave in space. Philipsz uses that physical fact to sculpt the very air we breathe. A Single Voice seems to isolate soundwaves and make you feel their reality in space-time.</p> <p>If that seems like science fiction, it is science fiction that has inspired this work. A Single Voice uses the score of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgZmZnxwBoQ\">Aniara</a>, a 1959 modernist composition by Karl-Birger Blomdahl based on an epic poem by <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1974/martinson-article.html\">Harry Martinson</a> about a group of would-be colonists of Mars who get stranded in space. The desolate notes of the violin, keening from one speaker to another, represent the doomed astronauts\u2019 soliloquies as they drift in the vacuum.</p> <p>Yet it is not the narrative of astral travel that makes this work of art so powerful as the tension it creates between sound and vision. Music, it makes you realise, goes straight inside us in a way that images cannot. Looking at Akhmetova on screen, we see her from the outside. The camera almost voyeuristically studies her face and body as she sits attentively and plays her part. Yet while the eye scrutinises, the ear empathises. The music seems a direct unmediated link between souls.</p> <p>In a darkened chamber at the end of the gallery, Philipsz sings alone. She is giving her rendition of every song on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie\">David Bowie</a>\u2019s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Not only does this earlier work (recorded in 2001) fit nicely with the sci-fi theme but once again it makes you feel the emotional mystery of music. Here is a fan offering her homage to Bowie, sending a message across the stars to him. It also reaches you, standing in the shadows, absorbed by this strangely intimate work. If Earth was really dying and we had five years left to live, you could do a lot worse than spend some of that time with this visionary artist.</p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/whats-on/exhibitions/susan-philipsz\">Baltic, Gateshead</a>, until 4 March<br /></li> </ul>",

          "body": "<p>The American composer <a href=\"http://philipglass.com/\">Philip Glass</a>, 80 this month, has been one of the dominant, boundary-crossing influences of the past half century. He first won a worldwide following in the 1970s with <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em>, <em>Einstein on the Beach </em>and <em>Satyagraha</em>, and has collaborated with Allen Ginsberg, Robert Wilson, Doris Lessing, Martin Scorsese, Ravi Shankar, David Bowie, Paul Simon and many more. Glass\u2019s birthday will be marked with a production by Scottish Opera of his opera <a href=\"https://www.scottishopera.org.uk/our-operas/16-17/the-trial\"><em>The Trial</em></a><em> </em>and a <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/music/series.asp?ID=1697\">Philip Glass at 80</a> weekend at the Barbican.</p> <p><strong>It seems that no one \u2013 not you, or Steve Reich, or John Adams \u2013 likes being called a minimalist. What do we call you if not that?</strong><br />Let\u2019s talk about this. The problem is no one is doing minimalism now. It\u2019s music we wrote in the 1970s. It\u2019s over 30 years out of date. It\u2019s a crazy idea to use a description made up by journalists and editors to cover all kinds of music. It\u2019s more confusing than descriptive. What do I really do? Listen to me. I\u2019ve written 26 operas, 20 ballets, I don\u2019t know how many film scores. I write theatre music. I write concert and symphonies too. I\u2019m working on a new film score right now. Then I\u2019ll start a new stage piece. My problem is people don\u2019t believe I write symphonies. But I\u2019m <a href=\"http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2017/1/31/0730/PM/Bruckner-Orchestra-Linz/\">premiering Symphony No 11 </a>in a couple of weeks. These are all different forms of music. Maybe I do too many things.</p> <p><strong>But it\u2019s the description that sticks: Philip Glass, the great American minimalist\u2026</strong><br />If people called me an American opera composer it would have the virtue of being what I actually do. This is reality. God forbid we should be accurate. I\u2019m not making this stuff up. Would it be easier to say I\u2019m an Icelandic composer who writes serial music? Would that be helpful? [Silence, then laughter.] I\u2019m a theatre composer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5a40bf39d6a41ac35a1efab698a9077c5805e74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a40bf39d6a41ac35a1efab698a9077c5805e74/452_0_1383_1569/881.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Glass in Linz, Austria earlier this month for rehearsals of his Symphony No 11.\" width=\"881\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Glass in Linz, Austria earlier this month for rehearsals of his Symphony No 11.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Werner Kerschbaummayr/ AFP/ Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of people want to hear my music of the 1970s and 1980s. And do you know what I do? I play it. I talk to Paul Simon or anyone like that and it\u2019s the same. I say, \u201cwhat do you play live, Paul?\u201d and he says \u201cI play my new songs and I play my hits\u201d. And it\u2019s true. If you go to hear Paul Simon, you want to hear Bridge Over Troubled Water. The new work, by the way, is beautiful, but it\u2019s not why you buy the ticket. You want to hear the old ones. It\u2019s the same for me when I play with my ensemble [the Philip Glass Ensemble]. We\u2019ve been together 40 years. We play the familiar stuff, the highlights.</p> <p><strong>So you\u2019re saying, then, you play\u2026 minimalism</strong>!<br />Well, yes, I admit I am part of the confusion. We\u2019ve reworked a piece from 1971. And, guess what, it\u2019s minimalist! OK OK OK, I\u2019m just as bad as the journalists [more laughs].</p> <p><strong>Growing up in Baltimore, Maryland, you stoked your own musical curiosity by listening to unsold stock in your father\u2019s record store. Was there one really striking discovery?</strong><br />Not one, though I listened to everything \u2013 what we called \u201chillbilly\u201d and Buddy Holly and R&amp;B, as well as Beethoven quartets and things that were quite modern then \u2013 Shostakovich and Bart\u00f3k. But as far as records in the shop were concerned, there was always lots of contemporary music \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.charlesives.org/\">Charles Ives</a>, the great American composer. And the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b086t9mw\">Second Viennese school</a> \u2013 Berg, Webern and, to a lesser extent, Schoenberg. I sent off for his book on basic harmony \u2013 couldn\u2019t find it in the Baltimore bookstores \u2013 and followed it to the letter. It was very traditional!</p> <p>But look, I was devouring a whole range of repertoire at that stage. I was studying music at the Peabody Institute. As a nine- or 10-year-old I was taking part in Bach masses in church performances. At high school they wanted to put on shows, so what did they do? Gilbert and Sullivan! I played flute in the orchestra. I got to understand how theatre works: the musicians in the pit, the timing, the getting singers on and off stage. It\u2019s not a bad way to learn your craft. It gave me a good solid background. When, years later, I came to write opera, I felt comfortable about all that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The people who don\u2019t want your music don\u2019t change their minds. You outlive them, if you\u2019re lucky</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You went off to the University of Chicago, prodigiously early at 15, then to the Juilliard school in New York. But the big break was when you went to Europe. You\u2019ve said you had two angels sitting on your shoulder, your two great teachers, Nadia Boulanger and Ravi Shankar.</strong><br />I\u2019ve always said one taught through fear, one through love. Nadia Boulanger was the great guru in Paris. She was tremendously fierce. She taught me Bach, Beethoven, Mozart \u2013 every tool of western art music \u2013 with an iron rod. It was, in essence, about understanding technique. Then there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ravi-shankar\">Ravi Shankar</a>, a master of Indian concert music. I met him in 1964. So I had two of the greatest exponents of different traditions at the same time. I was about 25 and Ravi was almost 20 years older. I was like a student. I stayed close to him for a long time. We collaborated. I spoke with him just days before he died.</p> <p><strong>Your long immersion in Indian music and philosophy, trying to go beyond cultural tourism, has shaped your outlook, practical and aesthetic\u2026</strong><br />That time in India, which included long stays as well as many shorter ones, visiting frequently from the late 60s until 2001, opened a door to the world of global music. Until then I\u2019d been immersed in European art music. In Kerala I encountered <a href=\"http://www.kathakali.net/\">kathakali</a>, the classical Indian dance theatre which had an influence on my own operas, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/25/how-we-made-satyagraha\"><em>Satyagraha</em></a>. Back then, hearing anything beyond western music wasn\u2019t easy. You couldn\u2019t find records, except a few specialist discs of music collected by anthropologists. If you wanted to hear Balinese music you pretty much had to go to Bali. It\u2019s hard to believe that now.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel you have done what you set out to achieve as a young man? Or does it only make sense now, looking back?</strong><br />I decided early on I wouldn\u2019t be a music teacher or an academic. So as soon as I got back from my studies in Europe in 1967 I formed my ensemble \u2013 seven musicians playing keyboards and a variety of woodwinds, amplified and fed through a mixer\u2026 I felt I had no choice but to be a performer. By then my flute playing had dropped off but I\u2019d sharpened up my keyboard skills. The point of the ensemble was to play the music I\u2019d written. We rehearsed in my house, we played my music! That was the deal. (We did make exceptions and play other stuff, when we rehearsed elsewhere.) And I could sense the response of the audience. Those audiences were tiny at first of course. Sometimes just 20 or so people. And then we got more successful, but it was a long, long time before we made any money. That took another 10 or 15 years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/oct/13/watch-a-clip-from-philip-glass-einstein-on-the-beach\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/56ztz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2793309\"            data-video-name=\"Watch a clip from Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57fb71d4e4b06538ee91e188\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/10/161010EinsteinOnTheBeach_KP-29666704_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/10/161010EinsteinOnTheBeach_KP-29666704.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/10/161010EinsteinOnTheBeach_KP-29666704_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/oct/13/watch-a-clip-from-philip-glass-einstein-on-the-beach\">Watch a clip from Philip Glass\u2019s Einstein on the Beach</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong><em>Einstein on the Beach</em> was a massive hit in 1976 yet you still had to drive a taxi and work as a plumber.</strong><br />Yes, after <em>Einstein on the Beach </em>I went back to driving a New York cab.

I was happy to do it. But it took at lot of time and work. In 1979 when we did our first Carnegie Hall concert we had to pay for it, and sell the tickets!

Indeed it is: among the theory\u2019s predictions was that violent events in the universe involving immense masses \u2013 such as the collision and merging of two black holes \u2013 could set the fabric of spacetime ringing, the ripples spreading across the cosmos and stretching or squeezing space as they pass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-answer-biggest-question-albert-einstein\">Gravitational waves may help us answer the biggest question of all | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experiments at the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory facilities in Washington and Louisiana have detected these distortions, and it\u2019s a tremendous, exhilarating moment for science. But it\u2019s been barely noted what a deeply strange, perhaps unprecedented situation this is too. The initial detection event happened last September, in the centenary year of the publication of Einstein\u2019s theory. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/25/video-100-years-of-einsteins-general-relativity\" title=\"\">the theory of general relativity</a> itself is a great rarity in science: for this was not an idea motivated by any need to explain observations, but the result of Albert Einstein simply sitting down and thinking. It isn\u2019t easy to find another example of such a rich, fertile theory conjured, as it were, out of nothing.</p> <p>No one was demanding a new theory of gravity in 1915. We already had one \u2013 devised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/isaac-newton\" title=\"\">Isaac Newton</a> more than two centuries earlier \u2013 and it seemed to work fine. Sure, there were a few little puzzles, such as the <a href=\"http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/26408/what-did-general-relativity-clarify-about-mercury\" title=\"\">anomalous motion of the planet Mercury</a>. But these weren\u2019t in any sense the stimulus for the new theory (even though it explained them). No, it arose because Einstein saw the world differently.</p> <p>It began in 1907, when Einstein was 28 and still working as a patent clerk. \u201cI was sitting in the patent office in Bern,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cwhen all of a sudden a thought occurred to me: if a person falls freely, he won\u2019t feel his own weight. I was startled. This simple thought made a deep impression on me. It impelled me toward a theory of gravitation.\u201d This, Einstein attested, was \u201cthe happiest thought of my life\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gjbp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2454865\"            data-video-name=\"Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56bcb63fe4b0d007e4723bec\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/11/160211GravWaves5_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-changes-everything-video\">Why discovering gravitational waves changes everything \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is what set Einstein apart: what seems trivially obvious to most people struck him as profound. Using a complex form of calculus called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar%E2%80%93tensor_theory\" title=\"\">tensor theory</a>, he spent eight years working on a new concept of gravity. The theory of general relativity showed that masses warp space and that in a gravitational field time slows down. It also predicted neutron stars and black holes, although they weren\u2019t accepted for many decades.</p> <p>Many physicists regard general relativity as a theory of exemplary beauty. But it\u2019s difficult too. Its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations\" title=\"\">10 equations</a> can be written down concisely using tensor notation, but in full they\u2019d take up many pages. The difficulty of solving the equations is one reason why, after being first vindicated in 1919 by observations of \u201cbent\u201d starlight during a solar eclipse, the theory languished for decades.</p> <p>Almost all science stems from a need to explain what we see: to solve empirical puzzles. But not general relativity. Are there any other cases where significant new scientific ideas have arisen without any observations demanding explanation? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/may/06/string-theory-and-black-holes\" title=\"\">String theory</a>, which attempts to unite general relativity with quantum theory, is juggling with scales and energies well beyond anything experimentally accessible, but still there\u2019s a clear motive: to reconcile two mutually incompatible ideas. Quantum theory itself is startlingly accurate with its predictions but current research into its underlying principles is motivated largely just because it appears so bizarre. It works but scientists want to\u00a0know why.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/12/gravitational-waves-explained\">Explain it to me like I'm a kid: scientists try to make sense of gravitational waves</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By contrast, Einstein seemed to invent general relativity simply because he wanted to \u2013 because he saw questions where others didn\u2019t.</p> <p>A more pertinent question, perhaps, is whether any young scientist could do that today. Einstein\u2019s \u201cmiraculous year\u201d of 1905, in which he not only deduced special relativity but also kick-started quantum theory and published several other ground-breaking papers, was an unrivalled creative burst. Yet any scientist\u2019s early career is often their most productive time, as it was with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/hawking\" title=\"\">Stephen Hawking</a>. Today, however, it\u2019s instead likely to be the most constrained and fraught.</p> <p>Young scientists now need more than ever to publish lots and quickly, to get grants and tenure, to justify the \u201cimpact\u201d of their work, and to carve out a niche for themselves, often in a highly specialised area. There is scant opportunity to just sit at a desk and ponder big questions.</p> <p>A century ago, general relativity had no obvious \u201cimpact\u201d, even though the GPS systems in today\u2019s smartphones rely on it. It didn\u2019t even have a clear goal, except intellectually. If Einstein\u2019s project had relied on a grant application today, it would surely be rejected; probably no young scientist could afford the luxury of contemplating it in the first place. It\u2019s not clear there is a space for Einsteins in modern science any longer.</p>",

It\u2019s an extended meditation, written in old age by a scion of one of Boston\u2019s elite families, on how the world had changed in his lifetime, and how his formal education had not prepared him for the events through which he had lived. This education had been grounded in the classics, history and literature, and had rendered him incapable, he said, of dealing with the impact of science and technology.</p> <p>Re-reading Adams recently left me with the thought that there is now an opening for a similar book, <em>The Education of Mark Zuckerberg</em>. It would have an analogous theme, namely how the hero\u2019s education rendered him incapable of understanding the world into which he was born. For although he was supposed to be majoring in psychology at Harvard, the young Zuckerberg mostly took computer science classes until he started Facebook and dropped out. And it turns out that this half-baked education has left him bewildered and rudderless in a culturally complex and politically polarised world.</p> <p>What is intriguing about the Facebook founder is his astonishing blend of high intelligence, naivety and hubris. In February, when it finally began to dawn on him that the election of Donald Trump might tell us something significant and disturbing about the state of the US society, he wrote a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10103508221158471/\" title=\"\">lengthy epistle</a> to his 86 million disciples.</p> <p>\u201cToday,\u201d it began, \u201cI want to focus on the most important question of all: are we building the world we all want?\u201d Ponder that for a moment: note the imperial, hubristic \u201cwe\u201d and the implicit assumption that it is possible to build a single world that everyone wants. It comes straight out of the Ladybird book of democracy. The epistle continues in the same vein. \u201cProgress now requires humanity coming together, not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.\u201d And of course Facebook would provide just such a community: after all, it already has more than 2\u00a0billion users, which is significantly more people than there are in China.</p> <p>When it began to dawn on people that the powerful ad-targeting machine that Zuckerberg and his associates had built might also have been used to nudge voters towards Trump and away from Clinton, Zuckerberg\u2019s response was a mixture of denial and incredulity. Then, as the evidence mounted that his machine had indeed been \u201cweaponised\u201d by political actors to send so-called \u201cdark posts\u201d to individual users, he pivoted rapidly from incredulity to scepticism and then \u2013 as the evidence became incontrovertible \u2013 to technocratic determination to \u201csolve\u201d the problem. In between, he took consolation from the fact that since everyone was now angry with Facebook, the company must be doing something right. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104067130714241\" title=\"\">Trump says Facebook is against him,</a>\u201d he wrote. \u201cLiberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don\u2019t like.

And therein lies a puzzle. For we know that the lad isn\u2019t stupid. Why then is he apparently behaving like an idiot? The answer is that he cannot come clean about the root of the problem, because to do so would reveal the unpalatable truth that it\u2019s a product of Facebook\u2019s business model.</p> <p>Facebook, like Google, is an extractive company, rather like ExxonMobil or Glencore. It \u201cmines\u201d, refines, aggregates and sells its users\u2019 personal information and data trails to advertisers, who then use it to target ads at said users. This data is clearly valuable. At the moment, for example, the company earns nearly <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/facebook-almost-20-per-user-us-and-canada-q4-2017-2\" title=\"\">$20 per user per year</a> (in the US and Canada, anyway) by monetising their data.

I am such a lucky guy that I cannot be upset with anything. I am upset with nothing. The only thing that upsets me a little bit is the kind of criticism to my players because my players are my players.</p> <p>\u201cI should protect them, I would love to protect them, and from you [media] I can\u2019t. It is something that is completely out of my control. That doesn\u2019t upset me, just gives me a feeling that it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s like when you want to protect people and you can\u2019t.

That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho has recently criticised in public the performances of Jesse Lingard, Luke Shaw, Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Daley Blind. Of this he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a learning process, you make a mistake, especially the kind of individual mistake, you have to learn with what that means for the team, a team that works during the week on a game plan.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes not during the whole week for the same match because now we are having a game every three days - but to try to have a game plan, try to identify some defensive and attacking agreements between all of us, then in the game the individual mistake you can be punished by that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-master\">Manchester United\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: no longer the bright young iconoclast | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt happened to us. We can obviously try to control our own mistakes, that\u2019s what we try all the time. The critique is part of the evolution, the critique is part of the process, the critique helps people to learn how to cope with critics. It\u2019s their life. From you, they cannot expect other thing than be ready to smash them when they have periods of not so much success.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho aimed another dig at his critics when speaking of Saturday\u2019s midday meeting with Leicester City at Old Trafford by mockingly describing himself as the poorest manager ever. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side are the champions and the 53-year-old pointed to his own record in making Chelsea only the second club \u2013 along with United \u2013 to retain the Premier League title.</p> <p>\u201cIt is obviously very difficult to retain the title \u2013 not for Leicester, for everyone \u2013 history says that. Not many teams during the Premier League history they could do that. One of the teams was, of course, Man United, another one was some team managed from the worst manager in the history of football, but it\u2019s really difficult</p> <p>\u201cBut the reality is I look at them and they are very good, they are very good. They won the Premier League because some of the big teams were not good enough last season, but they won because they were very good and they are still very good.</p> <p>\u201cI think they are a very easy team to analyse, a very easy team to understand. Their defensive process is clear, their attacking organisation is very easy to understand, too, but it is very difficult to cope with it. It is very difficult to keep a clean sheet against a team like Leicester and it is difficult to score goals against a team like Leicester. I keep repeating, easy to understand but difficult to play against.\u201d</p>",

Naturally, this sort of thing is liable to make therapists angry. (The correct response is to nod compassionately and ask: \u201cNow, <em>why </em>do you think that makes you so angry?\u201d) As Mark Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/23/therapist-self-help-therapy\">noted in this paper</a>, we should be wary of any finding that seems to suggest governments could save money by telling people to sort themselves out. But the self-help route has another limitation worth bearing in mind: what makes you so confident you even know what your problems really are?</p> <p>Typically, self-help works like this: you\u2019re troubled by some issue \u2013 procrastination, commitment-phobia, depression \u2013 so you seek a\u00a0book to fix it, just as you\u2019d seek a\u00a0spanner or screwdriver if the legs on your kitchen table started wobbling. But minds aren\u2019t like wobbly tables. There\u2019s no reason to\u00a0assume \u2013 actually, <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/every-school-of-psychology-has-its-own-theory-of-the-unconscious\">there\u2019s much reason to doubt</a> \u2013 that we\u2019re in touch with our deepest anxieties and hang-ups. Rather than productivity techniques, maybe you need to face the fact that your job provides no meaning. Maybe accusing yourself of \u201ccommitment-phobia\u201d is\u00a0how you rationalise the subconscious awareness that your partner doesn\u2019t love you. Maybe your depression is best understood not as the result of \u201cautomatic thoughts\u201d, but as a sign that you\u2019re living life to serve your parents\u2019 agenda, instead of your own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/28/stabbing-children-disease-ridden-needles-science-common-sense\">Common sense isn't always that sensible</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Or maybe not: probably, some problems are exactly what they seem. But the question is so personal that the best book in the world can\u2019t help but miss the mark, whereas another human at least stands a chance of hitting it. And if CBT is truly no better than self-help, maybe the right conclusion isn\u2019t that therapists don\u2019t matter, but that CBT isn\u2019t necessarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/07/therapy-wars-revenge-of-freud-cognitive-behavioural-therapy\">the apogee of therapy</a>?</p> <p>Crucially, the point isn\u2019t that therapists are wiser, thus better placed to tell you what your problems are. Rather, a good therapist will throw up roadblocks to your attempts to swiftly define the problem before hurrying on to fix it. This is the kernel of good sense in the cliche of the Freudian shrink who does nothing but rephrase his patient\u2019s comments as questions: he\u2019s refusing them the comfortable option of a one-size-fits-all solution, stubbornly forcing them toward self-understanding. Therapy isn\u2019t the only way to do this: journaling, meditation, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/10/not-self-help-great-advice-life-james-hollis-what-matters-most-jung\">some books</a> are among the others. What they all share is that they throw you back on yourself, blocking the easy but inauthentic alternative of using someone else\u2019s secondhand answer. As Albert Einstein is often quoted as saying, <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/22/solve/\">though he didn\u2019t really say it</a>: \u201cIf I\u00a0had only one hour to save the world, I would spend 55 minutes defining the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Plus, when it comes to psychology, there\u2019s a\u00a0bonus: half the time, a problem truly understood stops being a problem at all.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It is a dazzling cinematic montage of modern times that chews on everything from relativity to Leon Trotsky to the fantastic early films of Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. In a series of unapologetically epic and trenchantly emotional installations, Kentridge puts himself \u2013 and his country South Africa \u2013 into a grandiose history of life, the universe and everything, reinventing the shattered perspectives of early 20th-century modernism in an original, funny and profound way.</p> \n<p> History is a mad machine, propelling us ever forward. In Kentridge\u2019s awe-inspiring installation The Refusal of Time, a kind of huge perpetual motion machine \u2013 lovingly crafted out of wood \u2013 cranks its shafts and pumps its pistons while around it films are projected and speakers blare speech and music. But this no mere futurist chaos; there is method to Kentridge\u2019s madness. At the heart of this great speculation is the theory of relativity, which takes as its starting point the fact that light has a constant speed of 299,792,458 metres per second. If the speed of light is constant, explains the voice coming from the agitprop-style loudspeakers, it follows that time cannot be a stable quantity. This insight led to Einstein\u2019s most mind-boggling thoughts, and they inspires Kentridge to imagine human history as a film we can rerun, a sorrow that can be stopped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41474688a920483c6f63ce79f40bbdd41184dd07\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41474688a920483c6f63ce79f40bbdd41184dd07/0_0_4000_2610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Refusal of Time is on show at the Whitechapel Gallery, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Refusal of Time is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Peters/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> At the other end of the exhibition, after climbing a staircase decorated with a portrait drawn in black tape whose image fragments as you ascend, another crazy machine rattles away. This time it\u2019s a propaganda speaker built from flea-market finds that leads you into a bureaucratic office where Trotsky is lamenting the collapse of democracy in the Soviet Union. A Bolshevik commissar and his secretary change into dancing cyborgs, half-human and half-camera, in a sequence that is both a homage to the avant-garde film of revolutionary Russia and an image of a society becoming dehumanised.</p> \n<p> Kentridge\u2019s love of film is joyous, but shadowed.

We are\u00a0oxygen, hydrogen and\u00a0nitrogen, packed together with the carbon that photosynthesising life has plucked, one molecule at a time, from the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. At cremation, our bodies bake down to a handful of minerals. When Hamlet beseeched his too, too solid flesh to melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew, he got it about right: the Prince of Denmark would have been about 70% water, which is itself an atmospheric vapour. And he certainly could have been blown away.</p> <p>Harry Truman \u2013 \u201cnot that Harry Truman\u201d, as Sam Kean says in this bright and breezy book \u2013 was blown away by Mount St Helens. Truman was the defiant man who dismissed the warnings of volcanologists and refused to leave the high slopes of America\u2019s most violent modern volcano before it erupted in May 1980. Kean reconstructs his death because, as a chemist, he knows the temperatures at which water, viscera and bones could vaporise as a black cloud of intense heat, 100 storeys high and 10 miles wide, came roaring down the mountain at 350mph: \u201cTruman\u2019s clothes would have flared and disappeared, and then Truman himself would have sublimed in the scientific sense \u2013 transformed from solid to spirit almost instantly. And with a final hiss, he would have risen up into the air.\u201d</p> <p>As Kean says, there\u2019s a chance that your last breath contained just the tiniest whiff of the late Harry Truman, just as it quite possibly contains a remnant of the air exhaled by Julius Caesar as he cried \u201cEt tu, Brute,\u201d and expired. The atmosphere is vast, but so is the number of atoms and molecules inhaled with each breath: the number of lungfuls in the air and atoms in each lungful run to the billion trillions and more or less match. So each inhalation is also likely to incorporate the last wheeze of a dying tyrannosaurus 70m years ago; and the breath exhaled by Marc Bolan of T Rex as he sang \u201cLife\u2019s a\u00a0Gas\u201d, or by Joey Ramone of the Ramones (who wrote a different song of the same title).</p> <p>Our planet is for the moment an ideal home, solar-powered, air-conditioned, fitted with hot and cold running water and underfloor central heating, but it is the atmosphere that provides the currency with which life pays its way. This book starts with a blood-soaked toga and the conceit of Caesar\u2019s last gasp, but it does truly have an epic story to tell, and Kean takes us at a canter right through the entire 4.5bn year saga, from the moment of planetary assembly, mostly from interstellar gas molecules, to the chaotic challenge of planetary weather, the sorry comedy of\u00a0flying saucers at Roswell and the even more mournful tale of humanoid survivors from spaceship Earth \u2013 should there be any \u2013 in search of another habitable planet a\u00a0dozen light years away.</p> <p>Earth\u2019s first atmosphere during the Hadean period can hardly have been promising: the steamy magmatic exhalations would have been at pressures high enough to crush a human skull, but they cooled to condense into sea. Earth was also hit by another space object big enough to tilt it off its axis, and give it a companion moon: the same collision, says Kean \u201cnot only ejected our atmosphere, it\u00a0may well have boiled our frickin\u2019 oceans\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b00f548b8dea369bb4d202c2ba81d7c17ae49396\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b00f548b8dea369bb4d202c2ba81d7c17ae49396/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Nyos, Cameroon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake Nyos, Cameroon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s get this bit out of the way: at times, Kean takes his admirable conversational tone in directions not always familiar to those brought up\u00a0on\u00a0the measured language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/07/evolution-of-birds-from-dinosaurs\" title=\"\">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/09/is-richard-dawkins-destroying-his-reputation\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/01/nigel-calder\" title=\"\">Nigel Calder</a>.

The numbers, too, are numbing: we don\u2019t think in septillions but that\u2019s the traffic in oxygen molecules consumed by a human in 24 hours in the course of powering muscle movement. The poisonous gas hydrogen sulphide, for instance, makes up a vanishingly small component of the air, but you gulp 60m molecules every four seconds. You never think about the noble gases, but every four seconds you breathe in \u2013 and breathe out \u2013 20 quadrillion molecules of helium and 100 quintillion of argon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Albert Einstein makes an appearance as a fridge designer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The narrative embraces not just the nature of air but the breathtaking qualities of some of its gases, and their connection with human history, so there are enjoyable detours into the story of guano that \u2013 before the Haber-Bosch process \u2013 supplied the nitrogen that fuelled 20th-century food supply; and into the grim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/20/theobserver1\" title=\"\">deaths at Lake Nyos, Cameroon</a>, which in 1986 foamed like soda water, with deadly levels of carbon dioxide that killed 1,746 people. \u201cSurvivors remember an eerie stillness for days afterward.

My favourite nominates the 832\u00b0F temperature at which brimstone (hell has a lake of it, according to the Revelation of St John the Divine 21:8) remains liquid; and then takes the temperature of heaven (Isaiah 30:26 seems to say the sun shines sevenfold as the light of seven days). Temperature increases as the\u00a0fourth power of sunlight, so with\u00a049\u00a0suns heaven would enjoy a temperature of 1,000\u00b0F and therefore be hotter than hell. It\u2019s a helluva read.

          "body": "<h2><strong>1. His science</strong></h2> <p>Einstein was, first and foremost, a scientist. In 1905 and again in 1916, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/may/07/scientists-prove-einstein-right\">radically revised our understanding of the universe</a>. He was a pictorial thinker who came up with a new, intuitive sense of what reality looked like. Physics at the start of the 20th century was a rather settled endeavour, not seemingly in need of radical revision. We thought light was a wave and that duration, length and mass were objective facts of the world. We thought that space was a flat, Euclidean entity, unaffected by the distribution of matter and energy within it. Einstein, a mere patent clerk when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha\">he first began suggesting differently</a>, showed us that light must be thought of as a particle when it is emitted or absorbed, that matter is composed of atoms, that space is malleable, undulating with the distribution of the stuff within it, that how long or massive an object is or the time order of closely occurring events is not a fact of the world, but merely a fact of our point of view. He showed that these perspectival truths were well-behaved when they were placed in a four-dimensional conceptual framework. Seeing may be believing, but what we should believe about the universe, Einstein demonstrated, requires seeing it from a reference frame beyond that of the human senses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/may/04/einsteins-election-riddle-are-you-in-the-two-per-cent-that-can-solve-it\">Einstein's election riddle: are you in the two per cent that can solve it?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>2. His politics</strong></h2> <p>Einstein joked to his dear friend Max Born that he had a version of the Midas touch: everything he said turned to newsprint. Einstein\u2019s science made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2014/mar/14/albert-einstein-tongue-photography\">him a worldwide celebrity</a>, a status others might have enjoyed, but which Einstein despised. He was no shrinking violet, yet he detested the shallowness and meaningless absurdity that came with his universal adoration. But he realised that it could be handy. He was given a cultural megaphone and he decided that its best use was to amplify the concerns of those whose voices were least heard. Whether it was his own Jewish brethren suffering the insults of antisemitism, African-Americans suffering systematic racism, the poor kept down by structural barriers to advancement, or political dissidents in the Soviet Union who were being repressed, Einstein was unabashedly vocal in trying to change the institutions that led to inequality and injustice. His standing provided him with a unique place to speak for those who were silenced and he made great use of it in the name of universal human dignity.</p> <h2><strong>3. His immodesty</strong></h2> <p>Einstein never lacked confidence. Strengthened by his convictions, he was impervious to the power of those with superior social or professional standing, and resolute in his willingness to state his beliefs publicly. As social psychologists have shown since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/07/social-psychology-group-mentality\">famous experiments of Solomon Asch and Stanley Milgram</a>, humans are greatly influenced by the opinions of those around us, especially those who occupy positions of authority. We can shy away from reasonable and ethical beliefs, if we sense that we are in the minority for holding those views. But Einstein stands as an example of intellectual commitment. His revolutionary physical theories and his advocacy for peace at times of war and for better treatment of those in need were often unpopular. Einstein was investigated by the FBI for his views, and he received death threats from Nazi sympathisers. He was threatened with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jan/05/science.schools\">loss of his position at the Institute for Advanced Study</a> for his vocal support for his beliefs and causes. Yet he steadfastly refused to give in to fashion, expedience or groupthink. It is a cliche to say someone has the \u201ccourage of his convictions\u201d, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/05/albert-einstein-archive-genius-doubts-and-loves\">Einstein is a figure of great courage</a> in publicly expounding views he thought correct and morally necessary when such positions were dangerously unpopular.</p> <h2><strong>4. His modesty</strong></h2> <p>Einstein was flummoxed by his public reception. In one famous incident, he was accompanying Charlie Chaplin to the opening of his film <em>City Lights</em> when they were mobbed by thousands of fans. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Einstein asked Chaplin, who replied: \u201cNothing.\u201d We have a cognitive bias that leads us to be more apt to believe the praise we receive and to explain away criticism. We are the focus of our lives and with the contemporary cults of individuality and celebrity, too many people eagerly welcome the spotlight and take it as a sign of their superiority. But Einstein did not seek mass adoration or personal aggrandisement. He was not present to receive his Nobel prize. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/16/israel.india\">He refused the presidency of Israel</a>. He was willing to step into the public eye when it suited his causes, but he was not one to seek fame for the sake of fame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/21/even-albert-einstein-needed-more-than-curiosity-to-become-a-great-physicist\">Even Albert Einstein needed more than curiosity to become a great physicist | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>5. His meaning as a cultural symbol of modernity</strong></h2> <p>I often ask audiences: \u201cWhen I say the name Albert Einstein, what is the first thing that comes to mind?\u201d Regardless of the demographic or the country in which I ask this, inevitably the response is \u201cthe hair\u201d. Here is a man who changed the way the way we see reality, who stared down hatred and stood up for justice, yet despite all of this, the thing we immediately think of is that mane of unkempt, wild white hair. That may seem shallow of us, but I think it is a good thing. What does Einstein\u2019s hair signify? It was a political statement \u2013 he refused to conform to social standards of personal appearance. He was unapologetic in his individuality and unashamed of being different. Growing up a Jew in Wilhelmine Germany, where he was sent to a Catholic school, he was always aware of being an outsider and became not only comfortable with his distance from the mainstream, but took it as a mark of pride. On the one hand, Einstein is the very icon of the genius, someone whose innate intelligence made him radically unlike the masses. But in allowing his hair to become the spectacle it was, he became a symbol that said that special people can come from anywhere, can look like anyone. His physics appeared at a time when the regular order <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jul/17/henri-poincare-einstein-picasso\">was being challenged by modernist movements</a> in mathematics, science, art, religion, governmental and economic structures, even the very sense of what it was to be a human was being reconsidered from its core. Einstein, with his wild hair, signalled that human advancement comes not from the conformity the authorities demand, but from difference \u2013 and that all of us at various times in our lives feel a sense of alienation. Einstein gives us pride in ourselves as individuals who can make a difference; we can revel in free thought, but there is no need in doing so to reject our shared humanity.</p> <p>\u2022 Steven Gimbel\u2019s <em>Einstein: His Space and Times</em> is published by Yale.

It was the opposite of what people think.\u201d Lamarr also complains about Hollywood\u2019s obsession with appearances, which she found dull: \u201cThe brains of people are more interesting than the looks, I think.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, her roles repeatedly showcased her beauty and offered limited scope for acting. George Sanders, one of her co-stars, once said that Lamarr was \u201cso beautiful that everybody would stop talking when she came into a room\u201d.</p> <p>Her interest in radio communications seems to have been rekindled by the introduction in America of remote control systems for playing music, and by her concern about the German jamming techniques that prevented the use of radio-controlled torpedoes.</p> <p>She worked on her invention of an early form of \u201cspread spectrum\u201d telecommunications \u2013 in which a signal is transmitted on a much broader bandwidth than the original \u2013 together with her Hollywood neighbour, the avantgarde composer George Antheil, through the summer of 1940.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a34b8c924f042e45f68bb20689e50a75a077c04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a34b8c924f042e45f68bb20689e50a75a077c04/0_66_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Sarandon co-produced the documentary, Bombshell: the Hedy Lamarr Story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Sarandon co-produced the documentary, <em>Bombshell: the Hedy Lamarr Story.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their joint design employed a mechanism rather like the rolls used inside a pianola, or self-playing piano, to synchronise changes between 88 frequencies \u2013 the standard number of piano keys. The duo submitted a patent to the National Inventors Council on 10 June 1941, and it was granted a year later.</p> <p>While the idea was not entirely new, with German engineers winning patents for related work in 1939 and 1940, the United States navy classified the patent as \u201ctop secret\u201d. It took time, however, for the military to recognise how useful Lamarr and Antheil\u2019s bulky invention might become.</p> <p>After the war, in 1957, engineers at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division adopted it, and the navy began to use it to help transmit the underwater positions of enemy submarines revealed by sonar.</p> <p>In 1998, more than 50 years after their invention, the pair were honoured with an Electronic Frontier Foundation award.</p> <p>The actress, who once commented that her face was her \u201cmisfortune\u201d and \u201ca mask I cannot remove\u201d, may now gain some posthumous recognition as an inventor, but her most lasting legacy is still likely to be the striking features of Disney\u2019s Snow White, a cartoon character modelled on Lamarr.</p> <h2>LAMARR\u2019S LIFE</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, in Vienna, Austria, on 9 November 1913.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married six times including to Friedrich Mandl, an arms dealer, but fled her loveless marriage to be a Hollywood actress.</p> <p><strong>Film career</strong> Big break was a lead role in Gustav Machaty\u2019s <em>Ecstasy</em>, where she became the (probably) first Hollywood star to simulate a female orgasm on screen. The film sparked outrage and was attacked by Pope Pius XI. After leaving her husband she changed her name to Hedy Lamarr, and starred in the Hollywood film, <em>Algiers</em>. Other films included <em>Boom Town</em>, <em>My Favourite Spy</em> and <em>Samson and Delilah,</em> the highest grossing film of 1949.</p> <p><em>Algiers</em> (1938) was her first American film.</p> <p><strong>Inventions</strong> In 1942 Lamarr and her business partner, composer George Antheil, awarded a patent for a \u201csecret communication system\u201d for radio-guided torpedoes. Later, it became a constituent of GPS, wifi and Bluetooth. She also developed \u201dbouillon\u201d cubes to transform water into a Coke, and a \u201cskin-tautening technique based on the principles of the accordion\u201d.</p>",

The technique, which involves conjuring up vivid images of objects in a familiar setting, is credited to the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos, and is a favoured method among so-called memory athletes. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/mongolia-extreme-memory-tournament\">Extreme Memory Tournament: meet the Mongolian masters of the mnemonic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The study also revealed that after just 40 days of training, people\u2019s brain activity shifted to more closely resemble that seen in some of the world\u2019s highest ranked memory champions, suggesting that memory training can alter the brain\u2019s wiring in subtle but powerful ways.</p> <p>Nils M\u00fcller, a neuroscientist at Radboud University and a co-author, said: \u201cOne of the initial questions was whether memory athletes have very differently wired brains. Do they have an innate gift that just can\u2019t be taught?\u201d</p> <p>The answer, perhaps surprisingly, was no. Prodigious feats of memory such as recalling hundreds of binary digits or a Sherlock-like ability to put a name to a face are likely to be mostly down to hours of training and using the right mnemonic techniques, the scientists concluded.</p> <p>The study, published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30087-9\">Neuron</a>, recruited 23 of the 50 top-scoring memory athletes in an annual contest called the World Memory Championships. The athletes were given 20 minutes to recall a list of 72 random nouns and they scored, on average, nearly 71 of the 72 words. </p> <p>By contrast, an untrained control group recalled an average of 26 words. This group then followed a daily 30-minute training regime where they practiced walking through a chosen familiar environment, such as their own home, and placing objects in specific locations.</p> <p>Simonides was supposedly inspired to develop the \u201cloci\u201d technique after a gruesome tragedy in which a banqueting hall collapsed just after the poet had left the building. Some of his fellow diners were crushed beyond recognition, meaning they could only be identified based on the table plan.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.boriskonrad.de\">Boris Konrad</a>, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich who co-authored the study, said: \u201cYou really walk through a place and then later you visualise the location to place an object there. You\u2019re not just wandering around in your crazy mental palace.\u201d</p> <p>It also helps for the image to be vivid, bizarre and firmly placed in the location. In the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/10/moonwalking-einstein-joshua-foer-review\">Moonwalking with Einstein</a>, the memory expert Ed Cooke suggests remembering an item on a shopping list by imagining \u201cClaudia Schiffer swimming in [a] tub of cottage cheese.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/07/grandmaster-memory-teach-something-never-forget\">Let a grandmaster of memory teach you something you will never forget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Konrad, who also happens to be ranked 24th in the World Memory Championships, said the strategy is effective because it maps boring information onto something that the brain has evolved to do extremely well \u2013 recall imagery in specific locations.</p> <p>\u201cYou take material that is really hard to remember and transform it into something accessible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not make your memory capacity bigger; you use a different form of memory that already has a large capacity.\u201d </p> <p>After 40 days of 30-minute training sessions, the participants who had average memory skills at the start more than doubled their memory capacity, recalling 62 words on average \u2013 and four months later, without continued training, they could remember 48 words from a list of 72.</p> <p>Martin Dresler, also a neuroscientist at Radboud University and the first author, said: \u201cOnce you are familiar with these strategies and know how to apply them, you can keep your performance high without much further training.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists also studied the brains of their participants and, while there were no telltale signs of memory prowess based on anatomy, subtle differences were seen in the background brain activity of the memory athletes and ordinary subjects when they were asked to simply relax and let their minds wander. This kind of \u201cresting state\u201d scan is designed to give a measure of the brain\u2019s connectivity \u2013 essentially a measure of how tightly disparate clusters of neurons are wired together. </p> <p>After training, the background hum of brain activity in the ordinary participants had shifted to more closely match that seen in the champions \u2013 and the closer the resemblance, the better the person\u2019s performance was likely to be.</p> <p> \u201cAfter training we see massively increased performance on memory tests,\u201d said Dresler. \u201cNot only can you induce a behavioural change, the training also induces similar brain connectivity patterns to those seen in memory athletes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would speculate that it reflects activity-dependent rewiring,\u201d said M\u00fcller.</p> <p>Konrad believes that \u201cnot everyone can become a champion\u201d \u2013 even within the trained group some people fared far better than others. \u201cBut everyone using the technique can improve quite substantially from the level they\u2019re at,\u201d he added.</p>",

          "body": "<p>Deep underground, in a defunct gold mine in South Dakota, scientists are assembling an array of odd devices: a chamber for holding tonnes of xenon gas; hundreds of light detectors, each capable of pinpointing a single photon; and a vast tank that will be filled with hundreds of gallons of ultra-pure water. The project, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/30/dark-matter-lux-detector-particle\" title=\"\">LZ experiment</a>, has a straightforward aim: it is designed to detect particles of an invisible form of matter \u2013 called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/oct/02/dark-matter-did-we-just-hear-the-most-exciting-phrase-in-science\" title=\"\">dark matter</a> \u2013 as they drift through space.</p> <p>It is thought there is five times more dark matter than normal matter in the universe, although it has yet to be detected directly. Finding it would solve one of science\u2019s most baffling mysteries and explain why galaxies are not ripped apart by stars flying off into deep space.</p> <p>However, many scientists believe time is running out for the hunt, which has lasted 30 years, cost millions of pounds and produced no positive results. The LZ project \u2013 which is halfway through construction \u2013 should be science\u2019s last throw of the dice, they say. \u201cThis generation of detectors should be the last,\u201d said astronomer Stacy McGaugh at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find anything we should accept we are stuck and need to find a different explanation, perhaps by modifying our theories of gravity, to explain the phenomena we attribute to dark matter.\u201d</p> <p>Other researchers reject this view: \u201cTheory indicates we have a really good chance of finding dark matter particles,\u201d said Chamkaur Ghag, chair of the Dark Matter UK consortium. \u201cThis is certainly not the time to talk of giving up.\u201d</p> <p>The concept of dark matter stems from observations made in the 1970s. Astronomers expected to find that stars rotated more slowly around a galaxy the more distant they were from the galaxy\u2019s centre, just as distant planets revolve slowly round the Sun. (Outermost Neptune moves round the Sun at a stately 12,000mph; innermost Mercury does so at 107,082mph.)</p> <p>That prediction was spectacularly undone by observations, however. Stars at a galaxy\u2019s edge orbit almost as fast as those near its centre. According to theory, they should be hurled into space. So astronomers proposed that invisible dark matter must be providing the extra gravity needed to hold galaxies together. Proposed sources of dark matter include burnt-out stars; clouds of dust and gas; and subatomic particles called Wimps \u2013 weakly interacting massive particles. All have since been discounted, except Wimps. Many astronomers are now convinced they permeate space and form halos round galaxies to give them the gravitational \u201cmuscle\u201d needed to hold fast-flying stars in place.</p> <p>Getting close to Wimps has not been easy. Scientists have built increasingly sensitive detectors deeper and deeper underground to protect them from subatomic particles that bombard Earth\u2019s surface and which would trigger spurious signals. These devices resemble huge Russian dolls: a vast metal tank containing water \u2013 to provide added protection against incoming stray particles \u2013 is erected and, within this, a giant sphere of an inert gas such as xenon is suspended. Wimps making it through to the final tank should occasionally strike a xenon nucleus, producing a flash of light that can be pinpointed by electronic detectors.</p> <p>Despite three decades of effort, this approach has had no success, a failure that is starting to worry some researchers. \u201cWe are now building detectors containing more and more xenon and which are a million times more sensitive than those we used to hunt Wimps 30 years ago,\u201d said astrophysicist Professor David Merritt, of the Rochester Institute of Technology, New York. \u201cAnd still we have found nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Last July, scientists reported that after running their Large Underground Xenon (Lux) experiment for 20 months they had still failed to spot a Wimp. Now an upgraded version of Lux is being built \u2013 the LZ detector, a US-UK collaboration \u2013 while other devices in Canada and Italy are set to run searches.</p> <p>The problem facing Wimp hunters is that as their detectors get ever more sensitive, they will start picking up signals from other weakly interacting particles called neutrinos. Tiny, almost massless, these constantly whizz through our planet and our bodies. Neutrinos are not nearly heavy enough to account for the gravitational abnormalities associated with dark matter but are still likely to play havoc with the next generation of Wimp detectors.</p> <p>\u201cI believe the Wimp hypothesis will be truly dead when we reach that point,\u201d said McGaugh. \u201cIt already has serious problems but if we get to the point where we are picking up all this background interaction, the game is up. You will not be able to spot a thing.\u201d</p> <p>This point is rejected by Ghag. \u201cYes, occasionally a neutrino will kick a xenon nucleus and produce a result that resembles a Wimp interaction. We will, initially, be in trouble. But as we characterise the collisions we should find ways to differentiate them and concentrate only on those produced by Wimps.\u201d</p> <p>But there is no guarantee that Wimps \u2013 if they exist \u2013 will ever interact with atoms of normal matter. \u201cYou can imagine a scenario where dark matter particles turn out to be so incredibly weak at interacting with normal matter that our detectors will never see anything,\u201d said cosmologist Andrew Pontzen, of University College London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/26/vera-rubin-pioneering-astronomer-dark-matter-died-aged-88\">Vera Rubin, astronomer who helped find evidence of dark matter, dies at 88</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, it could transpire that a Wimp is completely incapable of interacting with normal matter. \u201cYou would then be saying we can only make sense of the universe by proposing a hypothetical particle that we can never detect,\u201d said Pontzen. \u201cPhilosophically that is a highly unsatisfactory situation. You would be saying you cannot prove or disprove a key hypothesis that underpins scientific\u00a0understanding.\u201d</p> <p>However, Pontzen also pointed out that dark matter has proved invaluable in making scientific predictions and should not be dismissed too quickly. \u201cScientists in the late 20th century attempted to predict what the cosmic background radiation left behind by the Big Bang 13 billion years ago might look like. Those who used dark matter in their calculations were found to have got things spectacularly right when we later flew probes to study that radiation background. It shows there was dark matter right at the birth of the universe.\u201d</p> <p>McGaugh is unconvinced. He points to the failure of Geneva\u2019s Large Hadron Collider, used to find the Higgs boson, to produce particles that might hint at the existence of Wimps. \u201cIt was hailed as the golden test but it has produced nothing, just like the other experiments.\u201d Instead, more effort should be directed to developing new theoretical approaches to understanding gravity, he argues. One such theory is known as modified Newtonian dynamics, or Mond. It suggests that variations in the behaviour of gravity could account for the unexpected star speeds. Such approaches should take precedence if LZ should fail to find dark matter in the next two or three years, McGaugh said.</p> <p>Ghag disagrees. \u201cI think it is ridiculous to suggest we stop,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we just going to say \u2018OK, we have no idea what makes up 85% of the universe just because we are finding it all a bit hard\u2019? That\u2019s not realistic.\u201d</p> <p>The uncertain nature of the problem was summed up by Pontzen. \u201cWe have been looking for dark matter for so long. Sometimes I think I should get real and admit something is up. On the other hand, the technology is getting better and we are opening up new possibilities of where to find dark matter. Which of these scenarios I feel closest to depends what sort of day I am having.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/nov/29/was-einstein-wrong-physicists-challenge-speed-of-light-theory-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5dg92\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2924993\"            data-video-name=\"Was Einstein wrong?

I recognise that I am not typical of most \u201cunqualified\u201d teachers. In fact, I fully agree with the sentiments of the letters published alongside my own. My essential point was that \u201cqualified\u201d is meaningless if the term means only that the candidate has qualified teacher status (QTS).</p> <p>To correct some of the misconceptions of other correspondents (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jul/30/good-teachers-need-more-than-lofty-qualifications\" title=\"\">Letters, 31 July</a>): I have never taught music in the private secondary sector; \u201csmall classes, large fees and levels of support\u201d are by no means common to all private establishments and the latter has certainly not been a feature of my own secondary teaching experience. Far from being unfamiliar with issues relating to \u201cchildren\u2019s safeguarding\u201d, as a head of an inner-city sixth form for eight years, I dealt with just about every pastoral concern from mental health issues to sexual assault, child abuse to suicide attempts. The classes I have taught during my 16 years in secondary education have generally been of fairly mixed ability, with many students requiring extra support. And it is because I have not only knowledge of and passion for my disciplines but also the ability to adapt to learners\u2019 needs (including those beginning or returning to education in their adult years), can empathise with others, and have an appetite for and commitment to hard work, that I have enjoyed a successful and rewarding career in several educational sectors \u2013 and continue to do so. There are many with QTS who have none of the latter qualities, as well as many who do.</p> <p>Of course, enthusiasm and classroom skills are essential, and hopefully rather more than \u201ca little knowledge\u201d. I am not sure why working in the private, higher and adult education sectors is presumed to preclude one from having these qualities.<br /><strong>Dr Claire Seymour</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Last week you ran a brilliant article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jul/25/no-such-thing-as-a-gifted-child-einstein-iq\" title=\"\">on there being no such thing as a \u201cgifted child\u201d</a> (Education, 25 July).

It\u2019s not a good goal</a>, Education, 1 August) show how confused our current education policy is in regard to equality of opportunity. I started teaching in 1972 after a year at Goldmiths doing an art teaching qualification. There we were taught the theory and firmly believed that all children had enormous capacity to learn and develop their ability to achieve whatever they wanted to do in life. Comprehensive schools were the key to giving all children this opportunity. These \u201c1960s\u201d leftwing liberal notions, now unfashionable, have been rejected in favour of children being taught to achieve within a standard measurement to fit league tables.</p> <p>In order to improve opportunity for all we need an education system for all, based on sound research and the principle of equality, as were the original comprehensive schools. Further fragmentation of provision with multi-academy trusts, \u201cfree schools\u201d and partnerships with \u201cpublic schools\u201d, all led by the DfE, will only lead to more inequality in our society.<br /><strong>Linda Karlsen</strong><br /><em>Whitstable, Kent </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

          "body": "<p>In a soft-furnished studio space behind a warehouse in west Berlin, a group of international scientists are debating our robot future. An engineer from a major European carmaker is just finishing a cautiously optimistic progress report on self-driving vehicles. Increasingly, he explains, robot cars are learning to differentiate cars from more vulnerable moving objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. Some are already better than humans at telling apart different breeds of dog. \u201cBut of course,\u201d he says, \u201cthese are small steps.\u201d</p> <p>Then a tall, athletic man with a light-grey three-piece suit and a greying goatee who has spent most of the morning playing with his smartphone strides to the podium, and suddenly baby steps become interstellar leaps. \u201cVery soon, the smartest and most important decision makers might not be human,\u201d he says, with the pitying smile of a parent explaining growing pains to a teenager. \u201cWe are on the verge not of another industrial revolution, but a new form of life, more like the big bang.\u201d</p> <p>J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber has been described as the man <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/27/technology/artificial-intelligence-pioneer-jurgen-schmidhuber-overlooked.html?_r=0\">the first self-aware robots will recognise as their papa</a>. The 54-year-old German scientist may have developed the algorithms that allow us to speak to our computers or get our smartphones to translate Mandarin into English, but he isn\u2019t very keen on the idea that robots of the future will exist primarily to serve humanity.</p> <p>Instead, he believes machine intelligence will soon not just match that of humans, but outstrip it, designing and building heat-resistant robots that can get much closer to the sun\u2019s energy sources than thin-skinned Homo sapiens, and eventually colonise asteroid belts across the Milky Way with self-replicating robot factories. And Schmidhuber is the person who is trying to build their brains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c43957f8fb9c56845ba903a271a7a7e7bc85b92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c43957f8fb9c56845ba903a271a7a7e7bc85b92/0_355_3852_2312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018By 2050, we will have AIs who are more intelligent than we are\u2019 ... a Pepper humanoid robot.

Pepper, a humanoid robot. Photograph: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we lower ourselves on to a pair of beanbags after his talk, Schmidhuber explains that in a laboratory in Lugano in the Swiss Alps his company <a href=\"https://nnaisense.com\">Nnaisense</a> is already developing systems that function much like babies, setting themselves little experiments in order to understand how the world works: \u201cTrue AI\u201d, as he calls it. The only problem is that they are still too slow \u2013 around a billion neural connections compared with around 100,000bn in the human cortex.</p> <p>\u201cBut we have a trend whereby our computers are getting 10 times faster every five years, and unless that trend breaks, it will only take 25 years until we have a recurrent neural network comparable with the human brain. We aren\u2019t that many years away from an animal-like intelligence, like that of a crow or a capuchin monkey.\u201d</p> <p>How many years, exactly? \u201cI think years is a better measure than decades, but I wouldn\u2019t want to tie myself down to four or seven.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask how he can be so confident about his timetable, he launches the hyperdrive. Suddenly we are jumping from the big bang to the neolithic revolution, from the invention of gunpowder to the world wide web. Major events in the history of the universe, Schmidhuber says, seem to be happening at exponentially accelerating intervals \u2013 each landmark coming around a quarter of the time of the previous. If you study the pattern, it looks like it is due to converge around the year 2050.</p> <p>\u201cIn the year 2050 time won\u2019t stop, but we will have AIs who are more intelligent than we are and will see little point in getting stuck to our bit of the biosphere. They will want to move history to the next level and march out to where the resources are. In a couple of million years, they will have colonised the Milky Way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d258e83c45c6485869d770afd50df084e1de8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d258e83c45c6485869d770afd50df084e1de8c/0_3_5695_3417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"To the stars ... robots will lead the way, says Schmidhuber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To the stars ... robots will lead the way, says Schmidhuber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He describes this point of convergence as \u201comega\u201d, a term first coined by <a href=\"http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-voices/20th-century-ignatian-voices/pierre-teilhard-de-chardin-sj\">Teilhard de Chardin</a>, a French Jesuit priest born in 1888. Schmidhuber says he likes omega \u201cbecause it sounds a bit like \u2018Oh my God\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Schmidhuber\u2019s status as the godfather of machine intelligence is not entirely undisputed. For a computer scientist, he can sometimes sound surprisingly unscientific. During his talk in Berlin, there were audible groans from the back of the audience. When Schmidhuber outlined how robots would eventually leave Earth behind and \u201cenjoy themselves\u201d exploring the universe, a Brazilian neuroscientist interrupted: \u201cIs that what you are saying? That there is an algorithm for fun? You are destroying the scientific method in front of all these people. It\u2019s horrible!\u201d</p> <p>When asked about those reactions, Schmidhuber has that pitying look again. \u201cMy theses have been controversial for decades, so I am used to these standard arguments. But a lot of neuroscientists have no idea what is happening in the world of AI.\u201d</p> <p>But even within the AI community, Schmidhuber has his detractors. When I mentioned his name to people working on artificial intelligence, several said his work was undoubtedly influential and \u201cgetting more so\u201d, but also that he had \u201ca bit of a chip on his shoulder\u201d. Many felt his optimism about the rate of technological progress was unfounded, and possibly dangerous. Far from being the true seer of the robot future, one suggested, Schmidhuber was pushing artificial intelligence to a destiny similar to that of the Segway, a product whose advent was hyped up as a technological revolution akin to the invention of the PC and ended up as a slapstick prop in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO17A8v5yL4\">Paul Blart: Mall Cop</a>.</p> <p>To understand why Schmidhuber yo-yos between prophet and laughing stock, one has to dive deeper into his CV. Born in Munich in 1963, he became interested in robotics during puberty, after picking up rucksacks full of popular science books and sci-fi novels from the nearby library \u2013 Olaf Stapleton\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/81969/star-men\">Star Maker</a>, ETA Hoffmann\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/18/sandman-eta-hoffmann-uncanny-essay-freud\">The Sandman</a> and the novels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/08/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Stanislaw Lem</a> were particular favourites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7071f9f11f82944cc8fb7e40ed03e9764614691/0_174_1529_917/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My wonderful idol\u2019 ...

Schmidhuber reveres Albert Einstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His great hero, \u201cmy wonderful idol\u201d, he says, was <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html\">Albert Einstein</a>. \u201cAt some point I realised I could have even more influence if I built something that is even smarter than myself, or even smarter than Einstein.\u201d He embarked on a degree in mathematics and computer science at Munich\u2019s Technical University, which handed him a professorship at the age of 30.</p> <p>In 1997, Schmidhuber and one of his students, Sepp Hochreiter, wrote a paper that proposed a method for how artificial neural networks \u2013 computer systems that mimic the human brain \u2013 could be boosted with a memory function, by adding loops that interpreted patterns of words or images in the light of previously obtained information. They called it Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).</p> <p>At the time, AI was going through a prolonged \u201cwinter\u201d: technology had failed to live up to the first wave of hype around artificial intelligence, and funding was hard to come by. In the 1960s, the hope had been that machines could be coded top-down to understand the world in all its complexity. If there is a new buzz now, it is around a seemingly simpler idea: that machines could be fitted with an algorithm that is relatively basic, but enables them to gradually learn bottom-up how complex the world really is.</p> <p>In 1997, Schmidhuber\u2019s paper on LSTM was rejected by MIT, but it now looks like one of the key concepts behind a new wave of interest in <a href=\"http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html\">deep learning</a>. In 2015, Google <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2015/07/neon-prescription-or-rather-new.html\">announced</a> it had managed to improve the error rate of its voice recognition software by almost 50% using LSTM. It is the system that powers Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and Apple announced last year that is using LSTM to improve the iPhone.</p> <p>If Schmidhuber had his way, the concept would get even more recognition. In a scathing 2015 <a href=\"http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-conspiracy.html\">article</a>, he complained that the \u201cCanadian\u201d trio of computer scientists hailed in Silicon Valley as the superstars of AI \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2015/7/15/11614684/ai-conspiracy-the-scientists-behind-deep-learning\">Geoffrey Hinton (Google), Yann Lecun (Facebook) and Yoshua Bengio (IBM)</a> \u2013 \u201cheavily cite each other\u201d, but \u201cfail to credit the pioneers of the field\u201d.</p> <p>During his talk in Berlin and our interview, he repeats emphatically, at regular intervals, like a jingle crashing through your Spotify stream, that the current buzz around computer learning is \u201cold hat\u201d and that LSTM got there many years earlier. He is quick to talk down the importance of Silicon Valley, which he feels is so dominated by \u201ccut-throat competition\u201d that it produces less value for money than European institutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b295f1c9d47d4e21463c51b568588f2dd055627a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b295f1c9d47d4e21463c51b568588f2dd055627a/0_66_2000_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Matrix ... \u2018the most idiotic plot of all time,\u2019 says Schmidhuber.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Matrix ... \u2018the most idiotic plot of all time,\u2019 says Schmidhuber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One possibility that presents itself when listening to Schmidhuber talk about the future of robotics is that his relentless techno utopianism is simply a strategy to make sure he doesn\u2019t end up as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/07/popandrock1\">Sixto Rodriguez</a> of AI, influential but overlooked while the Silicon Valley Dylans go down in the hall of fame.</p> <p>And relentless it is. Given his interest in sci-fi, has he never worried that robots will enslave and rule over us once they become self aware? Schmidhuber shakes his head. \u201cWe won\u2019t be enslaved, at the very least because we are very badly suited as slaves for someone who could just build robots that are far superior to us.\u201d He dismisses <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAAV9a4wwEA\">The Matrix</a>, in which imprisoned humans are used to power AIs: \u201cThat was the most idiotic plot of all time. Why would you use human bioenergy to power robots when a power station that keeps them alive produces so much more energy?\u201d</p> <p>But in that case won\u2019t robots see it as more efficient to wipe out humanity altogether? \u201cLike all scientists, highly intelligent AIs would have a fascination with the origins of life and civilisation. But this fascination will dwindle after a while, just like most people don\u2019t understand the origin of the world nowadays. Generally speaking, our best protection will be their lack of interest in us, because most species\u2019 biggest enemy is their own kind. They will pay about as much attention to us as we do to ants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8c18095f5c1fd12ed1219fe962841182214f19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8c18095f5c1fd12ed1219fe962841182214f19a/657_368_2482_5142/483.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A lot of neuroscientists have no idea what is happening in the world of AI.\u2019 Robot\" width=\"483\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A lot of neuroscientists have no idea what is happening in the world of AI.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Cros Garcia - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wonder if the analogy is less comforting than he intends. Surely we sometimes step on ants? Some people even use chemicals to poison entire colonies. \u201cOf course, but that only applies to a minute percentage of the global ant population, and no one seems to have the desire to wipe all ants off the face of this Earth. On the contrary, most of us are pleased when we hear there are still more ants on the planet than humans, and most of them are in the Brazilian jungle somewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWe may be much smarter than ants, but the overall weight of humans on this planet is still comparable to the overall weight of all ants,\u201d he says, citing a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29281253%20http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29281253%20http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29281253\">recently disputed</a> claim by the Harvard professor Edmund O Wilson.</p> <p>Let\u2019s forget about sci-fi, I say. What about more immediate concerns, like robotisation creating mass unemployment? In a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/there-is-a-blind-spot-in-ai-research-1.20805\">recent article</a> in Nature magazine, AI research Kate Crawford and cyberlaw professor Ryan Calo warned that the new wave of excitement about intelligent design was creating dangerous blindspots when it came to the social knock-on effects of replacing humans with robots.</p> <p>Again, Schmidhuber is not unduly concerned. The dawn of the robot future was clear to him when he fathered two daughters at the start of the millennium, he says. \u201cWhat advice do I give them? I tell them: your papa thinks everything will be great, even if there may be ups and downs. Just be prepared to constantly do something new. Be prepared to learn how to learn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHomo ludens has always had a talent for inventing jobs of the non-existential kind. The vast majority of the population is already doing luxury jobs like yours and mine,\u201d he says, nodding towards my notepad. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to predict which kind of jobs will disappear, but it\u2019s difficult to predict which new jobs will be created. Who would have thought in the 1980s that 30 years later there would be people making millions as professional video gamers or YouTube stars?</p> <p>\u201cEven highly respectable jobs in the medical profession will be affected. In 2012 robots started winning competitions when it came to screening cancer with deep neural networks. Does that mean doctors will lose their jobs? Of course not. It just means that the same doctor will treat 10 times as many patients in the same time he used to treat one. Many people will gain cheap access to medical research. Human lives will be saved and lengthened.\u201d</p> <p>Countries with many robots per capita such as Japan, Germany, Korea or Switzerland, he proposes cheerfully, have relatively low unemployment rates. I try to suggest that a truck driver in his 50s who has never heard of JavaScript may not quite share his optimism, but it\u2019s difficult to talk about the concerns of generations, not to say individuals, when arguing with someone who thinks in omega leaps.</p> <p>Whenever you try to drill into Schmidhuber\u2019s optimistic vision of the robot future, you encounter at its core a very simple scenario. When two beings have a conflict of interest, he says, they have two ways to resolve it: either by collaboration or through competition. Yet every time we encounter such a fork in the road in our conversation, collaboration wins out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35a671283532008c208c5c374265fa04e1dd60fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35a671283532008c208c5c374265fa04e1dd60fc/0_309_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018No one seems to have the desire to wipe all ants off the face of this Earth.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018No one seems to have the desire to wipe all ants off the face of this Earth.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I ask him whether robots of the future, on top of being curious and playful, will also be able to fall in love, he agrees, because \u201clove is obviously an extreme form of collaboration. The love life of robots will be polyamorous rather than monogamous: \u201cThere will be all sorts of relationships between robots. They will be able to share part of their minds, which humans currently can\u2019t, or only if they dedicate a lot of time to each other. There will be fusions of the kind that don\u2019t exist among biological organisms.\u201d</p> <p>If love is really just an intense form of collaboration, why does it feel so irrational? Why do we feel lust, or heartbreak? Schmidhuber doesn\u2019t pick up the bait. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got pain sensors, so that robots hurt themselves when they bump into something. And we\u2019ll work out the lust thing eventually. In the end, they amount to the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>What if one company, an Apple or a Google, builds up a monopoly stronghold over the supersmart robots that run the world in the future? He thinks that kind of dystopia, as evoked in Dave Eggers\u2019 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/09/circle-dave-eggers-review\">The Circle</a>, is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d. Here too collaboration will triumph. \u201cThe central algorithm for intelligence is incredibly short. The algorithm that allows systems to self-improve is perhaps 10 lines of pseudocode. What we are missing at the moment is perhaps just another five lines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we will develop those 10 lines in my little company, but in these times, when even Swiss banking secrecy is nearing its end, it wouldn\u2019t stay there. It would be leaked. Maybe some unknown man somewhere in India will come up with the code and make it accessible to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>If that sounds a little bit Pollyannaish, it\u2019s because Schmidhuber\u2019s own experience \u2013 the initial rejection of LSTM and his pervading distrust of \u201ccut-throat\u201d Silicon Valley \u2013 must have taught him that competition can create losers as well as winners. As disarming as his optimism can be on a personal level, I would feel a lot more comfortable with the idea of the most advanced beings of the future being midwifed by J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber if he was willing to articulate that doubt.</p> <p>He ends our conversation on an apologetic note: \u201cI am sorry you are talking to such a teenager. But I\u2019ve been saying the same things since the 70s and 80s. The only difference is that people are now starting to take me seriously.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p> Time is the most commonly used noun in the English language, yet we hardly understand what it is. The purer physical and mathematical aspects of time continue to be debated by the great minds of cosmology, and there are excellent books on that subject, from Stephen Hawking\u2019s A Brief History of Time to Richard Muller\u2019s more recent Now: The Physics of Time<em>. </em>But I\u2019ve always been drawn to the more tangible and human questions: how do our cells tell time, and how does that telling seep upward into the neurobiology, psychology, and consciousness of our species? How is it that our smartphones and wristwatches manage to consistently agree on what time it is? And the clocks inside us, how pliable are they? Can they be made to speed up, slow down, go backward? Why does time preoccupy us, and is there anything we can do about it?</p> <p>The search for answers to these questions consumed me for several years as I wrestled them into my latest book, <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/why-time-flies.html\">Why Time Flies: A Mostly Scientific Investigation</a>. What began as an intellectual journey morphed into something between a pastime and an obsession, accompanying me through one job and another, the birth of my children, pre-school, grade school, beach vacations, and countless cancelled dinner dates and blown deadlines. It was meant to be a book about time that I finished on time; it became a meditation on living life and not wanting time to end. Along the way, I read a great many books by other authors that dealt with time in one way or another; these are some of my favourites.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/confessions-14.html#\">Confessions by St Augustine</a><br /></strong>Departing from Zeno, Aristotle, and the other early Greek philosophers who struggled to understand the physics of time, Augustine, writing in the fourth century, was the first to talk about time as an internal experience \u2013 to ask what time is by exploring how it feels to inhabit it. He noted that what we call three tenses are really just shades of one: our present experience of the past (otherwise known as memory); our present experience of the future (anticipation), and our present experience of the present (attention). \u201cIn you, my mind, I measure time,\u201d he wrote \u2013 the credo for any modern scientist studying the perception of time.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong> 2. <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/time-machine-12.html\">The Time Machine by HG Wells</a><br /></strong>Still great after all these years! Unlike other time-travelling characters of late 19th-century literature, Wells\u2019s hero isn\u2019t a passive agent: he has a device with which he aims himself at the moment, past or future, of his choice. Wells was steeped in the latest scientific literature on memory, consciousness, visual perception, suggestion and illusion, and the opening chapter of this novel is effectively a short course on then-current notions of time perception. When the moment arrives to send a model of the time machine on its maiden voyage, it\u2019s the psychologist who flicks the switch.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong> 3. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/time-travel-514189.html\">Time Travel by James Gleick</a><br /></strong>The Time Machine is just the starting point for Gleick\u2019s joyous and engrossing survey of our species\u2019 preoccupation with the (entirely impossible) possibility of time travel. Cyberspace, time capsules, predestination; Dr. Who, Parmenides, Nabokov \u2013 Gleick is at home in every intellectual territory.

But the 10th of a second is fairly new, made accessible in the mid-19th century by advances in clock technology. Candles, a historian at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, recounts the emergence of this tiny yet vital window of time and its profound impact on the sciences, from astronomy to experimental psychology, and on society. Studies of reaction times, for instance, reveal that the speed of thought is not infinite: the impulse to lift a finger doesn\u2019t translate instantaneously into action, and the time lag (yes, about a 10th of a second) enabled scientists for the first time to put consciousness under the proverbial microscope.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\" /></strong></p> <p><strong> 7. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.popmatters.com/122889-cartographies-of-time-a-history-of-the-timeline-by-daniel-rosenberg--2496184563.html\">Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline by Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton</a></strong><br />An entertaining and lush history of humankind\u2019s efforts to visually represent time, from 1450 to the present.

Was it meant to destroy the observatory? Conrad thought so. The building housed a clock that defined Greenwich Mean Time, the standard time for the nation and, since 1884, the baseline for the entire world \u2013 as a symbol of industrialisation and government reach it would have been a tempting target.

Just as electric charge can be either positive or negative, matter could, hypothetically, have either positive or negative mass. </p> <p>For an object with negative mass, Newton\u2019s second law of motion, in which a force is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its acceleration (F=ma) would be experienced in reverse.</p> <p>Theoretically, this sounds straightforward, but picturing how this behaviour would work in the real world is bewildering, even for experts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very counterintuitive and weird,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics\">Jon Butterworth</a>, a physicist at University College London, who was not involved in the latest work.</p> <p>For instance, you might expect a ball with negative mass to be repelled from the Earth\u2019s surface, but theory predicts that it would behave just like ordinary matter and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/fact-and-fiction-about-negative-mass\">fall downwards</a>. </p> <p>No fundamental particles with negative mass have ever been discovered, meaning that there have never been any experimental insights into how they might behave \u2013 if, indeed, they exist. The latest study provides a new platform to study this hypothetical form of matter, by showing that under certain precise conditions, normal particles can be made to behave as though they had negative mass.</p> <p>\u201cIt provides another environment to study a fundamental phenomenon that is very peculiar,\u201d said Forbes.</p> <p>The experiment, described in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301\">Physical Review Letters</a>, created the conditions for negative mass by cooling rubidium atoms to just above absolute zero, creating something called a Bose-Einstein condensate.</p> <p>In this cooled state, particles move extremely slowly and, following the principles of quantum mechanics, behave like waves. This state of matter is already known to exhibit strange properties such as superfluidity, in which a liquid can creep up the sides of jars and over the top. </p> <p>The cooling was achieved by using lasers to slow the particles until they were confined in a laser trap, less than 100 microns across. Breaking the trap causes the rubidium atoms to rush out, expanding in a spherical formation.</p> <p>However, when researchers applied a second set of lasers that kicked the atoms back and forth within the trap, they started to behave as though they had negative mass on exiting the trap.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you push, it accelerates backwards,\u201d said Forbes, who acted as a theorist analysing the system. \u201cIt looks like the rubidium hits an invisible wall.\u201d</p> <p>Martin McCall, a professor of theoretical optics at Imperial College London, described the paper as a neat demonstration of a system exhibiting \u201ceffective negative mass\u201d \u2013 something that has only rarely been created before in laboratory conditions.</p> <p>But does it tell us anything about the possibility of cosmological wormholes or how hypothetical exotic particles might behave? \u201cPersonally I doubt it,\u201d said McCall. </p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.</p> <p>In the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body\u2019s nervous and hormonal systems.</p> <p>To test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. \u201cBehaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,\u201d Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.</p> <p>Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/28/maximum-human-lifespan-new-research-mortality\">Maximum human lifespan could far exceed 115 years \u2013 new research</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.</p> <p>\u201cThe mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing\u201d said Cai, whose study is published in <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature23282\">Nature</a>. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a tour de force,\u201d said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives.

And next week space scientists will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the publication of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity in fitting style \u2013 by launching a probe to help demonstrate the accuracy of the theory\u2019s last unproven prediction: the existence of gravitational waves.</p> <p>At 4.15am on 2 December, the satellite, known as <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/lisa-pathfinder/\" title=\"\">Lisa Pathfinder</a>, is scheduled to be blasted into orbit from the European Space Agency\u2019s centre in Kourou, French Guiana. It will carry equipment that will be tested as components for a future orbiting gravitational wave observatory.</p> <p>\u201cThe theory of general relativity is the scientific equivalent of Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.pedroferreira.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pedro Ferreira, professor of astrophysics at Oxford University</a>. \u201cBoth are unique works of genius and each could only have been done by one individual. And it is quite stunning that the Lisa Pathfinder satellite \u2013 which is designed to help find gravitational waves whose existence is predicted by the theory \u2013 is going to be launched on the exact anniversary of the publication of Einstein\u2019s work.\u201d</p> <p>Gravitational waves are thought to be hurled across space when stars start throwing their weight around, for example, when they collapse into black holes or when pairs of super-dense neutron stars start to spin closer and closer to each other. These processes put massive strains on the fabric of space-time, pushing and stretching it so that ripples of gravitational energy radiate across the universe. These are gravitational waves.</p> <p>Observations by US astronomers Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse in the 1980s provided key supporting evidence of their existence. The pair showed that a neutron star, now known as the Hulse-Taylor pulsar, was part of a binary system whose orbit was decaying at a rate consistent with it pumping out gravitational waves. This work won <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/\" title=\"\">Hulse and Taylor the 1993 Nobel prize in physics</a>. Since then, physicists have tried to spot gravitational waves directly, using ground-based devices with a common design: two long arms, set at right angles to each other, extending from a central point.</p> <p>When a gravitational wave strikes, it should temporarily shrink one arm and slightly extend the other. That change can then be measured \u2013 albeit with considerable difficulty, because any change induced in an arm\u2019s length by a gravitational wave will only be a few hundred billion-billionths of a metre.</p> <p>So far, researchers have yet to detect such changes. Once they do, one of the final hurdles to a complete understanding of the makeup of our universe will have been achieved. However, they are now extending their efforts to space because, in orbit, it should be possible to fly detectors that are 5 million kilometres apart and which will be better able to spot the compressing and stretching of space-time.</p> <p>\u201cOver these huge distances, the effect of a gravitational wave is much greater and so it becomes much easier to detect one,\u201d said Paul McNamara, the mission\u2019s project scientist.</p> <p>The Pathfinder probe will test equipment that will later be used to build a full-scale orbiting gravitational wave detector, a device that will be known as Lisa, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. However, astronomers will have to wait some time before it arrives because the European Space Agency does not plan to launch Lisa until 2034.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a simply a matter of budgets. There are so many other great space projects competing for money,\u201d said McNamara. \u201cNevertheless, a space-based gravitational wave observatory will revolutionise astronomy. We are not merely building a detector. We will have a machine that will use gravitational waves to study the universe.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be an observatory and it will use a completely new medium to peer into the universe\u2019s dark corners. Of course, a great many technological hurdles will have to be overcome. This is a very ambitious project. Nevertheless, we believe we can do it.\u201d</p> <p>At the heart of Lisa Pathfinder are two 2kg cubes of gold and platinum. These will be allowed to float free inside the craft, while being shielded from all forms of radiation and particle bombardment. The task of Lisa Pathfinder will then be to determine if it is possible to use lasers to measure deviations in their movements inside the craft with an accuracy of a trillionth of a metre. \u201cWe have worked very hard on this and we are sure that we can do it,\u201d added McNamara.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a great mission and the fact that it is going to be launched exactly 100 years after the publication about general relativity on 2 December, 1915, just makes the experience all the richer for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f227b4f6127a41a99a3f7fb87e947c729be8957\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f227b4f6127a41a99a3f7fb87e947c729be8957/2141_243_955_1433/666.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Einstein believed ripples of gravitational energy cross the universe.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Einstein believed ripples of gravitational energy cross the universe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/CORBIS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>THEORY THAT WAS YEARS IN THE MAKING</h2> <p>In his <em>On the General Theory of Relativity</em>, Albert Einstein took previous ideas about gravity \u2013 which had been seen as a force acting between objects \u2013 and replaced them with a description of it as being a geometric property of space and time.</p> <p>Many predictions emanated from this idea: the existence of super-dense collapsed stars \u2013 now known as black holes \u2013 gravitational lensing, in which light from a distant source is distorted by a huge, intermediary object, gravitational waves and many others.</p> <p>\u201cAll of these phenomena have now been observed \u2013 with one exception, and that is gravitational waves,\u201d said Pedro Ferreira, whose book <em>The Perfect Theory</em>, published last year, outlined the struggles that Einstein endured in working out his theory.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like a piece of art, the effort of one man, who struggled for seven years just to get things right,\u201d said Ferreira. \u201cHe worked on his ideas and equations exhaustively and then presented his theory in a series of lectures in November 1915 culminating in a final presentation on the 24th. Then he published in an unbelievably short time on 2 December.\u201d</p> <p>At the time the publication of Einstein\u2019s theory attracted little attention. Europe was then convulsed by war. However, the theory made global headlines shortly after the war, when the British astronomer Arthur Eddington studied star positions during a total solar eclipse and found their light was being bent by the Sun in a manner consistent with Einstein\u2019s theory.</p> <p>However, it took the development of radio astronomy to fully underline the importance of general relativity. \u201cAstronomers began to detect ultra-energetic, incredibly dense objects that could only be understood in terms of their gravitational fields,\u201d said Ferreira. \u201cGravity had to be really, really important, and the only theory that makes it possible for us to understand gravity is general relativity.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>My parents lived through the war. To be honest, I suspect many of the good folk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/dec/11/urbandesign.architecture\" title=\"\">New Earswick</a>, where my mum spent her childhood, did quite a bit of practising beforehand. A Quaker village without a pub or even a fish and chip shop for a Friday night treat is not the place to look for hedonistic abandonment to consumption. Most of the inhabitants worked at Rowntree\u2019s, which had built the model village on Quaker principles. The entire population was teetotal, apart from cheery Phyllis next door to my granny, who was always particularly cheery if you caught her between sherry time and bedtime \u2013 sherry time being before the main meal of the day, about noon. Everybody else drank Robinsons barley water and chirruped \u201cMy Drink Is Water Bright, from the Crystal Spring\u201d whenever an unwary visitor asked for anything stronger.</p> <p>When my mum was six, she managed to contract whooping cough, scarlet fever and rheumatic fever at the same time. Anybody who met her later in life would recognise this as a characteristically rational decision to get all the major illnesses over early. The downside was that Mum nearly died. Her mother\u2019s hair went white overnight, even though she was not yet 30, and she lost her appetite, which didn\u2019t help with the nursing. The village doctor, who seems to have had a broader remit than his modern counterparts, prescribed her Guinness: a bottle a night to build up her strength. As this was medicine, Granny obediently held her nose and drank, until she realised she was getting a taste for it. Horrified, she poured the rest down the sink, and never touched another drop in her life. Even the sherry for my parents\u2019 wedding reception had to be delivered straight to the village hall: she wouldn\u2019t have it under\u00a0her roof.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.quaker.org.uk/about-quakers/our-values\" title=\"\">four fundamental precepts of Quakerism are equality, truth, simplicity and peace</a>. My mother took to the first two with enthusiasm and natural talent. She rejected all hierarchies, obstreperously refused to fill in the space on any form asking for a title, and took a positive pleasure in honestly expressing her opinions, solicited or not. Gambling seemed to come under the heading of dishonesty, which made for awkwardness at the school Christmas fete when I had to explain that I couldn\u2019t help on the tombola and I didn\u2019t want any raffle tickets, because Quakers Don\u2019t Gamble.</p> <p>Her attitude to peace was borrowed from Einstein and Gandhi, who focused on the bigger picture in the wider world: she bravely volunteered to watch for bombs as a conscientious objector in the war, and worked tirelessly for various charities and good causes. But on the home front, the chords of domestic harmony were rarely in tune.</p> <p>Simplicity, in the form of minimal materialism, was Mother\u2019s milk. Literally. When I was a child, every kitchen window held a jam jar crammed with rancid silver milk bottle tops, destined for Guide Dogs for the Blind. Nobody knew what the dogs did with them, but we all collected them anyway.</p> <p>My mother didn\u2019t stop there. The paper from butter packets was kept for greasing cake tins. The thicker paper from cereal packets was kept for sandwiches. No piece of string, however minuscule, was ever thrown away.</p> <p>All this was explained away by the privations of rationing, but really, it had more to do with those Quaker principles. I don\u2019t go to Quaker meeting, but by the time I had my own family, I\u2019d discovered climate change. So I do everything she did, only more so. Even she didn\u2019t go to the shops with an assortment of used bags for her groceries.</p> <p>Of course, the crucial difference is that her motivation was the dogma of a rather joyless religion, whereas mine is the glorious fight to preserve the ecosystem for generations of baby turtles yet unborn. But an impartial observer might conclude that we\u2019re both just recycling jam jars, saving rubber bands, and putting the wrapping paper back in the drawer for next Christmas.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sheilahayman.com/\" title=\"\"><em>sheilahayman.com</em></a></p>",

          "body": "<p>In 1501, desperate for Leonardo to paint her portrait, the immensely rich Isabella d\u2019Este employed a friar to act as go-between. The friar met Leonardo in Florence but found his lifestyle \u201cirregular and uncertain\u201d and couldn\u2019t pin him down. \u201cMathematical experiments have absorbed his thoughts so entirely that he cannot bear the sight of a paintbrush,\u201d Isabella was told. With promises he\u2019d get round to it eventually, Leonardo kept her dangling for another three years. Pushy to the end, she changed tack and asked him for a painting of Jesus instead. Even then, he didn\u2019t come up with the goods.</p> <p>The story encapsulates contrasting versions of Leonardo that have been in\u00a0play ever since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/in-praise-of-giorgio-vasari\" title=\"\">Vasari</a> extolled him in his <em>Lives of the Artists</em>. On the one hand, the lofty genius who wouldn\u2019t kowtow to affluent patrons; on the other, the feckless fantasist who failed to fulfil his commissions. On the one hand, the Renaissance Man to whom maths and science were as important as painting; on the other, the artist who \u201cleft posterity the poorer\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/16/kenneth-clark-arrogant-snob-saviour-art\" title=\"\">Kenneth Clark</a>\u2019s phrase) by pursuing hobbies \u2013 engineering, architecture, pageantry, military strategy, cartography, etc \u2013 on which his talents were wasted. He achieved so much. But did multitasking prevent him achieving more?</p> <p>Walter Isaacson has no doubt about the answer. The subjects of his previous books \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/10/biography.features\" title=\"\">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\" title=\"\">Benjamin Franklin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/20/the-innovators-walter-isaacson-review-inventors-hackers-geniuses-geeks-digital-revolution-internet\" title=\"\">Ada Lovelace and Steve Jobs</a>, among others \u2013 were all blue-sky thinkers, with the ability \u201cto make connections across the disciplines\u201d and \u201cto marry observation and imagination\u201d. His life of Leonardo (rather cheekily subtitled \u201cThe Biography\u201d, as\u00a0if there were no others) doesn\u2019t neglect the paintings. But it\u2019s more fascinated by the notebooks, with their\u00a07,200 pages of sketches and ideas. Isaacson\u2019s premise is that Leonardo\u2019s scientific interests nourished his art \u2013 that only through the work he put into\u00a0dissecting corpses and studying muscles was he capable of painting the Mona Lisa\u2019s smile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"28d6ac1e8a1ed086a7eb65fe4df90cabe9d12809\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28d6ac1e8a1ed086a7eb65fe4df90cabe9d12809/0_0_3440_5118/672.jpg\" alt=\"The Mona Lisa.\" width=\"672\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The <em>Mona Lisa</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: History Archive/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gay, vegetarian, flamboyant in dress (with a preference for pink), erratic in his work habits and astute when it came to self-promotion, Leonardo would have felt at home among the hipsters of today. Being illegitimate was no great stigma: it meant he grew up with two mothers (which Freud thought explained a lot). It also saved him from becoming a notary, a profession closed to sons born out of wedlock. His lack of a formal education was no handicap, either. Self-taught, he derided \u201cpuffed up\u201d scholars who relied on received ideas: \u201cHe who can go to the fountain does not go to the water-jar.\u201d Experience was what counted, he said \u2013 that and a relentless curiosity.</p> <p>At 14, he was apprenticed to the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was (so Vasari claimed) \u201castonished\u201d by his talent and with whom he collaborated before producing at least two early masterpieces, <em>The Annunciation</em> and (his first non-religious effort, and one to rank with the <em>Mona Lisa</em>) <em>Ginevra de\u2019 Benci</em>. A charge of sodomy, involving a 17-year-old, might have halted his progress by landing him in prison or worse. But one of the four young men with whom he was accused had connections with the Medici family and the case was dropped.</p> <p>His attitude to sex was ambivalent: \u201cWhoever does not curb lustful desires puts himself on the level of beasts,\u201d he wrote, with conventional piety, but he also acknowledged that the penis \u201cpossesses a life and an intelligence separate from the man\u201d. His companion of many years \u2013 servant, pupil and the subject of many drawings \u2013 was the rascally Salai, who came to him at the age of 10. At some point they probably became lovers. Later, in his mid-50s, Leonardo adopted another young man, Francesco Melzi, whom he loved as a son.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, his depictions of men are more erotic than those of women. He described the act of coitus as \u201crepulsive\u201d; only the beauty of human faces redeemed the ugliness of genitalia. His lack of desire for women is perhaps what makes his paintings of them so tender and attentive: by objectifying less (and leaving their clothes on), he sees more. Some of his men look feminine, too. The angel in <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em> \u2013 intended to be Gabriel or Uriel \u2013 is often mistaken for a woman. A later drawing of an angel, either by Leonardo or by someone in his studio, showed a figure with breasts and an erect penis. Androgyny appealed to him. His men lack the muscularity of Michelangelo\u2019s nudes, which he dismissed as looking like \u201ca sack of walnuts rather than a human figure\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/20/leonardo-da-vinci-orphan-mother-caterina\">Tuscan archives yield up secrets of Leonardo\u2019s mystery mother</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rise of Michelangelo (20-odd years his junior) may have been a factor in his preference for Milan: having spent much of his 30s and 40s there, he returned in his mid-50s. It was a bigger city than Florence and was well stocked with intellectuals and scientists (less so with artists). Later he moved to Rome and later still, leaving Italy for the first time, to France. But it was Milan that encouraged the odd mixture of the practical and the fantastical that went into his inventions \u2013 his schemes for flying machines, giant crossbows, scythed chariots, needle grinders, screw jacks and so on. As Isaacson sees it, his inventions and ideas occupy an important place in the history of science and technology, anticipating the discoveries of Galileo and Newton. He contributed to medical knowledge too: by dissecting the body of a 100-year-old man, he came up with the first description of arteriosclerosis as an outcome of the ageing process. Even his wackiest ideas (such as the plan to protect Venice with a team of underwater divers wearing breathing apparatus) had potential, though it was several more centuries before scuba gear came along.</p> <p>Anatomy was his abiding specialism. Other artists might aspire to get the measure of man but he went about it literally, computing the right proportions (\u201cfrom the top of the ear to the top of the head is equal to the distance from the bottom of the chin to the duct of the eye\u201d, etc). This kind of perfectionism underlaid his reluctance to complete his paintings, notably <em>The Last Supper</em>, to which he\u2019d sometimes add just a couple of brush strokes before knocking off for the day (serious artists occasionally \u201caccomplish most when they work least\u201d, he told the impatient duke who\u2019d commissioned it), and the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, with which he fiddled on and off for 15 years and which was still in his studio when he died.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He described the act of coitus as \u2018repulsive\u2019; only the beauty of human faces redeemed the ugliness of genitalia</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like almost everyone who has written about it, Isaacson is reverential towards the <em>Mona Lisa</em>, though not as much as<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview13\" title=\"\"> Walter Pater</a> (\u201chers is the head upon which all the ends of the world are come\u201d) and not without using it to underline one of his main themes \u2013 Leonardo\u2019s sfumato technique, whereby lines are blurred and boundaries (like those between art and science) disappear. More illuminating is his account of the recent controversies over two other paintings attributed to Leonardo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/30/leonardo-da-vinci-experts-painting-la-bella-principessa\" title=\"\"><em>La Bella Principessa</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/20/artistic-license-experts-doubt-leonardo-da-vinci-painted-450m-salvator-mundi\" title=\"\"><em>Salvator Mundi</em></a>: through carbon dating and digital magnification, experts have assessed the key evidence (palm prints, left-handed brush strokes, stitching holes), but whether they\u2019re the genuine article remains a matter of dispute.</p> <p>Five hundred years on, you\u2019d have thought that everything it\u2019s possible to know about Leonardo would now be known, but authentication of his work remains an issue and surprises still keep turning up \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/dec/13/leonardo-da-vinci-lost-drawing-tajan\" title=\"\">lost drawing of Saint Sebastian</a> in 2016 and new details about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/20/leonardo-da-vinci-orphan-mother-caterina\" title=\"\">identity of his mother</a> Caterina only this year. Isaacson doesn\u2019t claim to make any fresh discoveries, but his book is intelligently organised, simply written and beautifully illustrated, and it ends with a kind of mental gymnastics programme that suggests how we can learn from Leonardo (Be curious, Think visually, Go down rabbit holes, Indulge fantasy, Respect facts, etc).</p> <p>Leonardo\u2019s notebooks are full of similar exhortations: \u201cGet a master of hydraulics to tell you how to repair a lock \u2026 Observe the goose\u2019s foot \u2026 Describe the tongue of the woodpecker.\u201d In\u00a0his thirst for knowledge, he was like a small child endlessly asking \u201cWhy?\u201d His last drawings were turbulent images of water and wind. You can read them as metaphors for apocalypse and death (he\u2019d had a stroke by then). Or as the culmination of a lifelong drive to find connections between natural phenomena \u2013 to link the curve of waves to a curl of human hair. Either way, Isaacson\u2019s claim that no other figure in history \u201cwas as creative in so many different fields\u201d doesn\u2019t seem far-fetched.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Leonardo da Vinci: The Biography</em> is published by Simon and Schuster.

He\u2019d never seen the point.</p> <p> But I discovered that this ex-student of mine is thriving. With a steady job, a vocation, and a good salary, he\u2019s found more self-worth than he\u2019d ever hoped to find in school. Despite most teachers telling him he \u201cwouldn\u2019t amount to anything without GCSEs\u201d, he\u2019s unrecognisably happy and healthy. Proving the system wrong, he wanted me to be proud of him. </p> <p>And I am. But I feel guilty, too. School was hell for him. I remember the fists through walls, broken knuckles, the fights. He was frustrated. I\u2019d told him he needed an English GCSE to move on to grander things. I perpetuated the myth that without GCSEs he would fail. </p> <p>But now I think I was wrong. There are plenty of people who, despite the threat of lifelong failure, go on to do great things. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/a-level-results-2016-ucas-richard-branson-message-virgin-founder-grades-not-everything-a7197721.html\">Richard Branson</a> is usually trotted out as the go-to example, but some report even Einstein left secondary school with <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/08/25/15-people-who-did-amazing-things-without-amazing-exam-results-5940967/\">no formal qualifications</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The nature of study often turns subjects of joy into exercises of misery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Qualifications have their place, of course, but some students see GCSEs as the gateway to conform, not be informed. Put simply, these courses don\u2019t always feel relevant. These subjects are learned to pass exams, not gain a living knowledge. With their academic frames so distant from real-life experience, GCSEs aren\u2019t useful, creative, productive or fun. </p> <p>To make matters worse, GCSE failure lands squarely on the shoulders of students and teachers. The complaints of \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d are ignored and aren\u2019t treated as symptomatic of a systemic problem. Rather, the students themselves are considered a problem \u2013 the bad eggs preventing schools from improving those all-important performance statistics marking out \u201csuccess\u201d.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the answer? As Niace finds, to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.learningandwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Engaging-learners-in-GCSE-maths-and-English.pdf\">make English and maths engaging</a>, \u201clearners need to see the purpose and relevance of what they are learning\u201d. So I believe we must make these subjects meaningful in a real-world context (even the most disengaged have shown to be hardworking during <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/2002722/Stahl_and_Dale_2012_Creating_Positive_Spaces_of_Learning_DJers_and_MCers_Identity_Work_with_New_Literacies?auto=download\">tasks meaningful to them</a>). Who, for the love of Pythagoras, draws triangles just to calculate their hypotenuse? Instead, why not learn the great man through productive activity, like the construction of buildings or designing of video games? Learning is much more effective when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/2152/1/Removing%20barriers%20to%20literacy.pdf\">students focus on topics they actually find interesting</a>.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-vocational-education-the-wolf-report\">Wolf report</a> back in 2011, I thought there may be a shift for English and maths to focus on \u201cemployment outcomes rather than an accrual of qualifications\u201d. Yet we\u2019re seeing none of this. Attempts at making learning relevant are but token offerings, while work experience placements become solely the remit of independent schools or those with resources to support them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/jun/10/secret-teacher-evidence-free-schools-results\">Secret Teacher: we need evidence on free schools, not blind faith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So if the government isn\u2019t going to step up, perhaps we can find ways to form links between businesses and schools.

Now five separate research teams have launched critiques of the work in a series of papers in the journal Nature.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/05/human-lifespan-has-hit-its-natural-limit-research-suggests\">Human lifespan has hit its natural limit, research suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Together they present the case that there is no compelling evidence that we are approaching an upper limit on our mortality \u2013 or at the very least, that such a limit may be considerably higher than 115 years.</p> <p>Prof Jim Vaupel, a specialist in ageing at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany and one of the authors, said: \u201cThe evidence points towards no looming limit. At present the balance of the evidence suggests that if there is a limit it is above 120, perhaps much above \u2013 and perhaps there is not a limit at all.\u201d</p> <p>The dispute between Jan Vijg, the geneticist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York who authored the original paper, and the critics, has become unusually heated, with both sides stepping beyond the typically restrained bounds of scientific discourse.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the worst piece of research I\u2019ve ever read in Nature magazine,\u201d said Vaupel. \u201cI was outraged that a journal I highly respect would publish such a travesty.\u201d</p> <p>Vijg is equally strident, implying that his critics are, to some extent, simply upset at being confronted with their own mortality.</p> <p>The original study used the <a href=\"http://www.supercentenarians.org/\">International Database on Longevity</a>, which compiles lists of the age of the oldest person to die in a given year. It found the maximum reported age of death increased rapidly between the 1970s and early 1990s, but then appeared to plateau in the mid-1990s at 114.9 years.</p> <p>The latest papers argue that this conclusion is wrong and offer a host of more optimistic interpretations. Prof Siegfried Hekimi from McGill University in Montreal said: \u201cYou can show the data are compatible with many different trajectories and not at all an ongoing plateau.\u201d</p> <p>Under one such scenario, lifespans would be predicted to climb steadily upwards, such that the oldest person alive by the year 2,300 would be expected to be 150 years old. \u201cThe increase in average lifespan will not suddenly crash into a 115-year limit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hemiki said there was annoyance about the levels of media attention the Vijg paper received, because \u201cpeople like a number\u201d, despite the fact that \u201cthe data were strikingly unconvincing\u201d.</p> <p>One complaint was that Vijg\u2019s analysis partitioned the data into two time periods \u2013 before and after 1995 \u2013 on the back of a visual inspection that appeared to show a levelling off around this year. When the two underlying trends were calculated, the period after 1995 had a flat gradient, appearing to confirm the hypothesis.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t do in statistics,\u201d said Hekimi. \u201cIt\u2019s circular.\u201d</p> <p>Another problem is that when any data series is segmented, there may appear to be temporary plateaus or even declines, despite an overall upward trend \u2013 as seen in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump_world_record_progression\">long-jump records, for instance</a>.</p> <p>Another of the critiques notes that the headline result \u2013 the flat gradient after 1995 \u2013 is based on just 12 data points and could simply reflect the inclusion of Jeanne Calment, a French woman who died in 1997 at the record-breaking age of 122 years. If this datapoint was shifted forward a few years to 2004, the apparent plateau vanished.</p> <p>Vijg counters that a dataset focused on the oldest people on Earth is always going to be small. \u201cWhen you look at these super-old people, there are not many of them. That\u2019s kind of the point, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Maarten Rozing of the University of Copenhagen said there was little to suggest the existence of a \u201cbiological clock\u201d programmed to limit the length of life. \u201cWe now know not only that the idea of such a clock is highly implausible, but also that ageing is proving to be more amenable to change than used to be supposed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Vijg said he accepts \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d in the latest criticisms, dismissing them as statistical nitpicking by those who \u201chadn\u2019t read his paper properly\u201d.<br /></p> <p>He compared the suggestion that there was no lifespan limit in sight to Zeno\u2019s paradox, where an arrow is shot at a tree and first travels half the distance and, from the halfway point, half the distance again, in an apparently unending journey.</p> <p>\u201cThey try to come up with intricate models to show that mortality is actually decreasing with very old age,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than science fiction.\u201d</p>",

At present, <a href=\"http://furthermaths.org.uk/files/FMSP-Girls-in-Maths.pdf\">65% of boys</a> who get As in GCSE maths choose to take it at A-level, while <a href=\"http://furthermaths.org.uk/files/FMSP-Girls-in-Maths.pdf\">only 43% of girls</a> do so. Of all students, <a href=\"http://furthermaths.org.uk/encouraging-girls-maths\">39% of maths candidates, and just 27% of further maths candidates</a>, are female. Students are often unaware that top universities require double maths (maths and further maths) at A-level for maths, physics, computer science or engineering degrees, so this has negative consequences for their participation in Stem courses and careers. </p> <p>As a maths teacher at a large sixth form college, I\u2019m concerned by the disproportion of female students in the department. I spoke to three groups of girls in year 12 about their experiences; one not studying maths, those studying single maths, and those studying double maths. Based on their feedback, I have the following suggestions for encouraging more girls to take the subject at A-level.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t perpetuate the idea of a \u2018maths brain\u2019</h2> <p>One student who does not study maths said that she didn\u2019t \u201chave a maths brain\u201d and was \u201cnot actually very good\u201d. This was echoed by many who hadn\u2019t taken A-level maths, despite getting A*s at GCSE. Curiosity, persistence and hard-work are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jul/25/no-such-thing-as-a-gifted-child-einstein-iq\">attributes of high performers</a> , according to research by Deborah Eyre. Teachers need to praise these characteristics and avoid language that implies \u201cnatural ability\u201d. Many teachers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/jan/09/growth-mindset-practical-strategies-classroom\">aware of this</a> but the students\u2019 feedback suggests this hasn\u2019t transferred effectively to the classroom, where success is often tied to speed.</p> <h2>Use competition with caution</h2> <p>Typically, girls respond less well to competition. Those I spoke to were demoralised by competition within lessons and in comparing test results. As such, teachers using competition in the classroom should design collaborative competitions where students have clear (and changing) group roles. We should avoid focusing on speed, applauding good teamwork instead.</p> <p>Students in all groups felt their test results defined their \u2018rank\u2019 in the class. Teachers must explain that only a narrow selection of mathematical skills are examined. It is important students know that tests provide an opportunity for them to showcase understanding of these skills, but don\u2019t define their potential as a mathematician.</p> <h2>Interact with us, encourage us \u2013 but don\u2019t patronise us</h2> <p>\u201cI always felt that [the teacher] was a little bit tired of the girls or something. I don\u2019t know, maybe she didn\u2019t like us.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/feb/10/chinese-teaching-primary-maths\">Why are we blindly following the Chinese approach to teaching maths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Students who are not studying maths described top set classes at secondary school full of \u201cloud and confident\u201d boys who didn\u2019t fear shouting out an incorrect answer, who had \u201cbanter\u201d with the teachers and who were \u201calways\u201d chosen to demonstrate work. One student mentioned two apparently-able boys in her class: \u201cIf you were stuck, you could go to them and they\u2019d explain it.\u201d This is a familiar social norm, but teachers must also offer female students positive experiences of explaining their work.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/10/generation-z-latest-data-teens\">Generation Z</a> is under pressure to look and act a certain way \u2013 a problem amplified by social media. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/23/girls-and-social-media-you-are-expected-to-live-up-to-an-impossible-standard\">Girls are often more affected</a> , reducing their confidence in the classroom. Male students also struggle with low confidence, of course, but maths teachers <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/teachers-underrate-girls-maths\">underestimate girls\u2019 performance relative to boys of the same level</a>, according to researchers in the US. </p> <p>To address these issues, teachers can keep track of the number of one-to-one interactions with each student. A <a href=\"https://www.miniwebtool.com/random-picker\">random name selector</a> would ensure all students have the opportunity to participate in whole-class discussions.</p> <h2>Inspire us</h2> <p>Many in the double maths group said they found the subject to be uninspiring until year 10. Teachers need to get girls interested in maths before choosing their GCSEs and younger students should encounter a variety of challenging maths problems. Classrooms are full of students with a range of tastes in mathematics and it\u2019s hard to predict which concepts will engage students\u2019 curiosities, so let\u2019s bring what we find beautiful about mathematics into the classroom.</p> <h2>Show us examples of women doing mathematics</h2> <p>\u201cWhen I think of a mathematician, I don\u2019t think of a woman,\u201d said one student in the single maths group. Students also discussed \u201chating the feeling of panic\u201d when stuck on a maths problem.</p> <p>Stereotype threat, outlined in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/10/gender-gap-myth-cordelia-fine\">Fine\u2019s \u2018Delusions of Gender\u2019</a>, \u201ccan do more than impair performance \u2013 it can also reduce interest in cross-gender activities\u201d. It\u2019s exacerbated by imagery that confirms the stereotype, so the examples of mathematicians that we use (at all levels) should be 50% female.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/15/secret-teacher-pupils-forced-maths-never-use\">Secret Teacher: pupils are force-fed maths they'll never use again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/13/interview-maryam-mirzakhani-fields-medal-winner-mathematician\">Maryam Mirzakhani</a>, the first female Fields medallist, could be valuable to share: \u201cOf course, the most rewarding part is the \u2018aha\u2019 moment, the excitement of discovery and enjoyment of understanding something new \u2013 the feeling of being on top of a hill and having a clear view. But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being on a long hike with no trail and no end in sight.\u201d</p> <p>Gendered classroom practices have negative implications for students of all genders: a more inclusive classroom would benefit everyone.<br /></p> <p><em>Grace Geilinger is a maths teacher at Brighton, Hove &amp; Sussex Sixth Form College. </em></p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuardianTeacherNetwork/\">Facebook</a>, and join the <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/agree/GTNF?returnUrl=https://teachers.theguardian.com/Registration.aspx\">Guardian Teacher Network</a> the latest articles direct to your inbox</strong></p> <p><strong>Looking for a teaching job?

His narrator notices women in the street who have stepped out of \u201cthe new and perishable universe\u201d created by Renoir; as the novelist Bergotte dies, he muses about a \u201clittle patch of yellow wall\u201d in a Vermeer view of Delft, a symbol of aesthetic perfection and a memento of the imperfect world he is leaving.

Until now, the farthest researchers had ever sent entangled photons stood at a mere 65 miles, less than one tenth of the distance achieved in the satellite experiment.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a first step, and a major step, toward creating a global quantum network,\u201d said Pan. \u201cAll the previous methods are limited to about 100km so can only work within a city.\u201d</p> <p>The experiment relied on the world\u2019s first quantum-enabled spacecraft: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/china-launches-quantum-satellite-for-hack-proof-communications\">a Chinese satellite called Micius</a>. As it soared over China, the satellite created pairs of photons with properties that were linked through quantum entanglement. It then beamed these simultaneously to ground stations in Delingha, Lijiang and Nanshan. Each pair of particles travelled up to 1,240 miles before they reached their destinations. Details of the study are published in <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aan3211\">Science</a>.</p> <p>Pan said that the kind of cryptography used to keep data safe today relies on complex mathematics which can often be defeated by hackers. \u201cIf a future quantum network is established, the security is ensured by the laws of physics, which are unconditionally secure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be beneficial for all human beings.\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/06/quantum-computing-explained-particle-mechanics\">Quantum computing explained: harnessing particle physics to work faster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin Stevens, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, said he was impressed with the work. \u201cThese types of experiments are not easy to do, even within the controlled confines of a laboratory environment. Doing them between two remote ground locations and a satellite flying overhead at a speed of thousands of kilometres per hour is mind-bogglingly difficult.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, Stevens sent entangled photons down a 65 mile length of optical fibre. That is good enough for quantum communications between neighbouring towns, but it cannot work for much greater distances, because the signal is gradually lost the more optic fibre it travels down. The advantage of using a satellite is that the particles of light travel through space for much of their journey.<br /></p> <p>Anton Zeilinger at the Vienna Centre for Quantum Science also praised the work. \u201cIt\u2019s an important step towards a worldwide quantum network. If you envisage a quantum network, the question is how to cover large distances and that cannot be done with glass fibres on the ground. You have to go into space, because in glass fibres you lose the signal. It\u2019s very important to show that it works with satellites, so I\u2019m very excited by this.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Zeilinger is working with Pan on an intercontinental quantum network and hopes to have results to report before the end of the year.<br /></p>",

          "body": "<p>A century after Albert Einstein formulated general relativity, the theory holds a profoundly strange place in modern life. On one hand, it underwrites all the marvels of technology today, from smartphones to space probes. We wouldn\u2019t be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/messenger2011\">tweeting from orbit around Mercury</a> without the physics Einstein published in 1915. On the other hand, while a fair number of people can tell you what special relativity\u2019s E=MC<sup>2</sup> stands for, a vanishingly small number can claim to really understand the universe as Einstein\u2019s famous equation reveals it to us.</p> <p>The popular understanding of relativity comes almost entirely from science fiction. A crew of astronauts crash land on a planet populated by apes, where humans are mutes kept as cattle. But it\u2019s only when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvuM3DjvYf0\">Charlton Heston screams \u201cYou maniacs, you blew it up!\u201d at Lady Liberty</a> that the other moon boot drops: we\u2019re on Earth after a nuclear apocalypse, transported into the future as a result of time dilation, an effect of relativity predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/25/video-100-years-of-einsteins-general-relativity\">Video: 100 years of Einstein's General Relativity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pierre Boulle\u2019s 1963 novel La Plan\u00e8te des Singes, via its Hollywood movie adaptation, arguably remains the most famous illustration of relativity in sci-fi. But Boulle\u2019s story is less about science than it is about humanity, with time dilation simply providing what the critic <a href=\"http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/14/suvin14art.htm\">Darko Suvin describes as the \u201cnovum\u201d</a>, the pivotal idea around which any sci-fi metaphor is constructed. Boulle exploits relativity to transport his readers into the future \u2013 but only to show us the folly of the present.</p> <p>For most of the 20th century, SF went out of its way to dodge relativity. The postulation of warp engines, hyperdrives and other varieties of faster-than-light (FTL) transportation is less a scientific idea than a dramatic device. In space opera novels such as Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune or CJ Cherryh\u2019s Alliance-Union series, FTL is first and foremost a way to play out human political dramas that would be impossible if it took eight centuries to travel between locations. We want stories told on a human scale, but on the scale of a relative universe, human stories don\u2019t even register.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/aug/06/guardianobituaries\">Poul Anderson</a>\u2019s Tau Zero won the Hugo award for best novel in 1971 for it\u2019s hard-edged take on relativity and space travel. Fifty colonists travel from Earth on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_ramjet\">Bussard ramjet</a>-powered spacecraft. An onboard malfunction causes the ship to continue accelerating endlessly, taking ship and crew far beyond the limits of light-speed, flying between galaxy superclusters with all they know left billions of years in the past.</p> <p>From its title \u2013 a reference to <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LorentzTransformation.html\">the Lorentz equations that underpin relativity</a> \u2013 to Anderson\u2019s frequent authorial interventions explaining the science of relativity, Tau Zero dedicates itself to showing us a relativistic model of the universe.

Vernor Vinge\u2019s A Fire Upon the Deep incorporates the tricky question of consciousness into relativity, describing a galaxy in which the speed of thought increases the further life travels away from the \u201cunthinking depths\u201d of the galactic core.</p> <p>In Shikasta, the wide-ranging imagination of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dorislessing\">Doris Lessing</a> took the union of consciousness and physics to its ultimate conclusion, in a universe where travel between worlds is achieved by the passage through higher planes of existence that we would probably recognise as forms of heaven or nirvana. It\u2019s one of SF\u2019s strange conundrums, that the further it projects hard scientific fact into our future, the more it arrives back at a vision that echoes the myths of spirituality and religion.</p> <p>\u201cReality becomes illusory and observer-oriented when you study general relativity.

Joe Haldeman\u2019s SF classic makes a beautiful literary device of time dilation and relativity, as its protagonist is sent on multiple tours of duty in a war against aliens that explicitly echoes Haldeman\u2019s own experiences in the Vietnam war. Every time Mandella returns home he is further forward in human history, and further isolated from the world he knew.</p> <p>It\u2019s the illusory, observer-oriented nature of reality that the theory of relativity brings us crashing up against.

          "body": "<p>A fictional mill town is the setting for new school drama <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/ackley-bridge\"><strong>Ackley Bridge</strong></a> (Channel 4). Two schools, one predominantly Asian, one mainly white, have been merged to form Ackley Bridge College. Desegregating Yorkshire, it could have been called, if it was a documentary. (In fact, it was: you may recall Newsnight\u2019s series on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/05/integrated-school-waterford-academy-oldham\">a similar real-life merger in Oldham</a>.)</p> <p>The new school has a new logo (a blue hand holding an orange hand; someone must have told the designer that the point of the new academy was to unite Iggle Piggle with Donald Trump). And a new sponsor, local mattress mogul Sadiq Nawaz, who takes a close interest in the day-to-day running of the place, and an even closer one in headteacher Miss Carter. Well, that\u2019s what Mr Carter thinks. Actually, Miss Carter\u2019s husband, the PE teacher, is called Mr Bell. \u201cEnd!\u201d shouts a kid, inevitably, but still amusingly.</p> <p>Things at the new school don\u2019t start brilliantly. Neighbours and best mates (but for how much longer?) Missy and Nasreen soon find themselves on different sides of a divide \u2013 a racial one \u2013 that quickly appears. Football teams pick themselves according to skin colour. Everyone might be in the same school now, but it doesn\u2019t look any more integrated.</p> <p>A kid called Jordan Wilson, also known (by himself) as Abdullah bin Kevin, doesn\u2019t help, by adopting a hijab and announcing he\u2019s a revert (\u201cpervert, more like\u201d \u2013 inevitably, amusingly).</p> <p>Jordan is the best character at Ackley Bridge \u2013 smart, offensive to everyone, the school wind-up merchant, who also represents a pessimistic but realistic view that such attempts at integration are futile. \u201cDo they think they can keep us quiet with a lick of paint and some crap about learning to live together?\u201d he asks the school after breaking into the office and taking over the public address system. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter if you\u2019re white or Asian, there\u2019s no jobs for us, we\u2019re all going nowhere. We, we\u2019re the immigrants, the benefit scroungers. If you\u2019re white, you\u2019re racist. And if you\u2019re Asian, you don\u2019t belong.\u201d</p> <p>The teachers aren\u2019t a whole lot better than they kids. Well, there\u2019s the Carter-Bell-Nawaz love triangle. And Mr Bell rips the hijab off an Asian girl, thinking she\u2019s a not-Asian boy (Jordan). And eventually he loses it completely and punches Jordan. I know, it\u2019s never right for a teacher to hit a pupil, but if ever a punch was a teeny bit justified, this one is.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s Miss Keane, a hippy-dippy flippy-floppy backpacker who only just makes it back from the airport in time for the beginning of term. Her backpack went missing, hence the inappropriate footwear. Miss Keane is locked in a custody battle with her ex over their daughter. Neither of them wants Chloe; they\u2019re battling not to have custody of her. Chloe repays her mum by showing up in her class with a hangover and then throwing up in the bin. Then, for extra revenge, she tweets a picture of her mum\u2019s boobs, with a twist-of-the-knife hashtag: #AckleyBridgeCollege.</p> <p>Ackley Bridge is very social media savvy; additional content was aired, pre-launch, on Snapchat, to drum up a bit of buzz. It\u2019s kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/apr/02/waterloo-road-axed-long-running-drama\">Waterloo Road</a> meets Shameless (the opening scene of Missy and Naz on a sofa, in a skip, drinking cider, giggling and quoting Einstein, could have come from the latter). However, despite the similarities, and Albert\u2019s words (\u201ceducation is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school\u201d), it\u2019s not as clever as Paul Abbott\u2019s show, nor does it have the performances. There\u2019s not a hell of a lot of subtlety going on in Ackley Bridge: it is drama shoved in your face, like a Grange Hill sausage on a fork.</p> <p>But then Ackley Bridge is for a younger audience, all the family ... almost (not you, go to bed, now). The parallel-communities thing gives it something else, as well as ringing true about Britain today, asking questions about whether total integration is possible, even necessary, both in school and out of school. That side of things is handled carefully and sensitively. Real issues aren\u2019t avoided, cultural differences aren\u2019t denied; at the same time, obvious and boring stereotypes are avoided.</p> <p>If that makes it sound worthy, it really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s pleasingly loud and mischievous. Well, it\u2019s school, of course it is. As well as boobs, Ackley Bridge has balls. And a heart.</p>",

          "body": "<p>I can\u2019t remember exactly when I stopped dreaming of nuclear annihilation. It must have been the 90s, when my fear of nuclear war was subsumed by other fears, maybe even some optimism. This fear was huge during the 80s. When the great storm of 1987 hit, I remember all the trees crashing and electricity going off and thinking: \u201cWell I suppose this is it. Something to do with Iran,\u201d and going back to sleep. Slow environmental collapse took over from the imagining of a nuclear winter. Now I fear terror and robots more. Both on the same day sometimes.</p> <p>It is remarkably easy, though, to resuscitate that old fear because it was all-engulfing at the time. The doctrine of mutually assured destruction was its highest goal. Those were the days, my friend. We thought we would all end.</p> <p>And here we are back again with Trump, who is forever warning us that the world is hell but threatening to make it more so. Does he really have the little plastic card known as \u201cthe biscuit\u201d that has to be snapped in two to reveal the nuclear codes? Strange times indeed when half the world is wishing it could be taken away from him. Presumably in a military coup.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/08/donald-trump-north-korea-missile-threats-fire-fury\">\u201cFire and fury\u201d</a> is an attempt at biblical language to describe mass murder. This is being said while people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/aug/06/after-the-atomic-bomb-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-then-and-now-in-pictures\">remember Nagasaki</a> and recount the details of the aftermath. A place, we are told, where the living envied the dead, where skin hung off children like cloth, where victims lay in darkness, their wounds full of maggots.</p> <p>Yet anyone who opposes nuclear weapons is accused of being naive beyond belief. Disarming in a multilateral world is an impossible ideal. As that ideal gets further away, so, until recently, has the idea of nuclear war.</p> <p>This was not always the case. In the 80s, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) was huge and multi-generational. Indeed, on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1866956,00.html\">huge CND march in 1983</a>, when a million people came out on the streets, some of us were frustrated by how polite it all was. I had been at Greenham Common and wanted more direct action. CND seemed too woolly, and indeed there was a lot of criticism of Greenham as a women-only space from within its ranks.</p> <p>Nonetheless Michael Heseltine, minister of defence in 1983, was absolutely determined to undermine CND by spying on and bugging activists. CND was seen as a threat in itself. Not to want nuclear proliferation was, and remains, a challenge to the status quo. As Martin Amis said in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_Monsters\">Einstein\u2019s Monsters</a>: \u201cHow do we prevent the use of nuclear weapons. By threatening the use of nuclear weapons \u2026 the intransigence, it seems, is a function of the weapons themselves.\u201d Amis was derided at the time for his apocalyptic visions because this was 1987, and negotiations between Reagan and Gorbachev would result in <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/8/newsid_3283000/3283817.stm\">the non-proliferation Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a> in 1988. Membership of CND fell, people felt safer.</p> <p>But that moment is worth remembering now we have these two narcissistic monsters (the other being Kim Jong-un) threatening each other with warheads. How can this be de-escalated? \u201cNuclear war. LOL,\u201d as Twitter would have it. \u201cWe will all be gone in a flash.\u201d No we won\u2019t. Only the lucky ones will.</p> <p>I know this because the horror of nuclear weapons was brought home to us in the 80s. The terror was domesticated, and it was domesticated through the culture. This was extremely important. The \u201cprotect and survive\u201d leaflets of 1980 were seen as a kind of joke by many. The peace campaigner EP Thompson, of course, produced <a href=\"http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/113758\">Protest and Survive</a> as a response. The government had suggested that you could construct a fallout shelter out of cardboard. Or get under the table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/09/trump-brink-nuclear-war-stop\">Trump has taken us to the brink of nuclear war.

Ten years later, life is returning to a medieval barbarism, with the government communicating to its small population only through radio.</p> <p>There was no \u201cduck and cover\u201d from the early propaganda films. The cheerful advice on how to survive a nuclear war was meaningless. This imagining of the darkness was crucial, but since then the fear has faded, replaced by other horrors perhaps.</p> <p>Nowadays, CND and its aims are regarded as slightly out of step.

But we can only see part of what happens in the universe. Gravitational waves carry completely different information about phenomena in the universe. So we have opened a new way of listening to a broadcasting channel which will allow us to discover phenomena we have never seen before,\u201d he said. </p> <p> \u201cThis observation is truly incredible science and marks three milestones for physics: the direct detection of gravitational waves, the first detection of a binary black hole, and the most convincing evidence to date that nature\u2019s black holes are the objects predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory.\u201d</p> <p> The scientists detected their cataclysmic event using an instrument so sensitive it could detect a change in the distance between the solar system and the nearest star four light years away to the thickness of a human hair. </p> <p>And they did so within weeks of turning on their new, upgraded instrument: it took just 20 milliseconds to catch the merger of two black holes, at a distance of 1.3 billion light years, somewhere beyond the Large Magellanic Cloud in the southern hemisphere sky, but it then took months of meticulous checking of the signal against all the complex computer simulations of black hole collision to make sure the evidence matched the theoretical template. </p> <p> The detector was switched off in January for a further upgrade: astronomers still have to decipher months of material collected in the interval. But \u2013 given half a century of frustration in the search for gravitational waves \u2013 what they found exceeded expectation: suddenly, in the mutual collapse of two black holes, they could eavesdrop on the violence of the universe. </p> <p> Prof B S Sathyaprakash, from Cardiff University\u2019s school of physics and astronomy, said: \u201cThe shock would have released more energy than the light from all the stars in the universe for that brief instant. The fusion of two black holes which created this event had been predicted but never observed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/02/gravitywave-zip/giv-27167Dz4AE8qnlMPa/\" data-alt=\"Gravitational waves\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/02/gravitywave-zip/giv-27167Dz4AE8qnlMPa/\">Gravitational waves</a> </figure>  <p> The finding completed the scientific arc of prediction, discovery and confirmation: first they calculated what they should be able to detect, then decided what the evidence should look like, and then devised the experiment that clinched the matter. Which is why on Thursday scientists around the world were able to hail the announcement as yet another confirmation of their \u201cstandard model\u201d of the cosmos, and the beginning of a new era of discovery.</p> <p> Astronomers have already exploited visible light, the infrared and ultraviolet, radio waves, x-rays and even gamma-rays in their attempt to understand the mechanics of stars, the evolution of the galaxies and the expansion of the universe from an initial big bang 13.8bn years ago.</p> <h2><strong>Unequivocal</strong></h2> <p>Thursday\u2019s announcement was the unequivocal first detection ever of gravity waves. The hope is that gravity wave astronomy could start to answer questions not just about the life of stars but their deaths as well: death by collision, death in a black hole, death in some rare stellar catastrophe so fierce that, for a few thousandths of a second, the blast is the brightest thing in the universe.<br /></p> <p> Even before the Ligo detectors in two US states reopened for business late last year, researchers were confident that a detection would follow swiftly. The announcement came after months of speculation, and decades of theoretical and practical work by an international network of more than a thousand scientists and engineers in Britain, Europe, the US and around the world.</p> <p> Professor Kip Thorne, of the California Institute of Technology, and one of the founding fathers of Ligo, said that until now, astronomers had looked at the universe as if on a calm sea. All of that had changed.</p> <p> \u201cThe colliding black holes that produced these gravitational waves created a violent storm in the fabric of space and time, a storm in which time speeded up and slowed down, and speeded up again, a storm in which the shape of space was bent in this way and that way,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Prof Neil Turok, director the <a href=\"https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/\">Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics </a>at Waterloo in Canada, and a former research colleague of Prof Stephen Hawking, called the discovery \u201cthe real deal, one of those breakthrough moments in science\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11cfd2383f7eaf7964dbfce254cea2d47fe0c70c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cfd2383f7eaf7964dbfce254cea2d47fe0c70c/0_0_3134_1881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ligio co-founder Rainer Weiss, left, and Kip Thorne, right, hug on stage during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ligo co-founder Rainer Weiss, left, and Kip Thorne, right, hug on stage during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Not only had the detector picked up the collision of two enormous black holes across a distance of almost a billion light years of space, it recorded the distinctive \u201cchirp\u201d as the two spiralled towards each other.</p> <p> The discovery, he said, completes a scientific arc of wonder that began 200 years ago, when the great British scientist Michael Faraday began to puzzle about how action was transmitted across the distance of space; how the sun pulled the Earth around. If the sun moved 10 yards, very suddenly, would the Earth feel the difference?</p> <p> He reasoned that something must cross space to transmit the force of gravity. Faraday\u2019s reasoning inspired the great British mathematician James Clerk Maxwell to think about how an electric force travelled, and arrive at an understanding of light and a prediction of radio waves.</p> <p> \u201cEinstein, when he came to write down his theory of gravity, his two heroes were Faraday and Maxwell,\u201d said Turok. \u201cHe tried to write down laws of the gravitational field and he wasn\u2019t in the least surprised to discover that his predictions had waves, gravitational waves.\u201d</p> <p> The Ligo discovery signals a new era in astronomy, he said.</p> <p> \u201cJust think of radio waves, when radio waves were discovered we learned to communicate with them. Mobile communication is entirely reliant on radio waves. For astronomy, radio observations have probably told us more than anything else about the structure of the universe. Now we have gravitational waves we are going to have a whole new picture of the universe, of the stuff that doesn\u2019t emit light \u2013 dark matter, black holes,\u201d he said.</p> <p> \u201cFor me the most exciting thing is we will literally be able to see the big bang. Using electromagnetic waves we cannot see further back than 400,000 years after the big bang. The early universe was opaque to light. It is not opaque to gravitational waves. It is completely transparent.</p> <p> \u201cSo literally, by gathering gravitational waves we will be able to see exactly what happened at the initial singularity. The most weird and wonderful prediction of Einstein\u2019s theory was that everything came out of a single event: the big bang singularity. And we will be able to see what happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline to this article was amended on 12 February 2016. An earlier version said the discovery was a breakthrough after two centuries of expectation. This has been corrected.<br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p></p>",

          "body": "<p>Is giftedness a case of nature or nurture? Opinion is divided. While one school of thought says that some children <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/gifted/how-do-i-know-if-my-child-is-gifted/\">have an innate ability to achieve higher</a> than their peers, others will argue that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jul/25/no-such-thing-as-a-gifted-child-einstein-iq\">most people can reach standards of performance</a> associated with being gifted and talented. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/jul/27/how-do-we-boost-childrens-brainpower-live-chat\">our recent Q&amp;A</a>, experts discussed the latest thinking on how people become high performers and what teachers and parents can do to help young people excel in their chosen areas. Here\u2019s a summary of their thoughts: </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2017/aug/02/create-culture-excellence-schools-students-teachers\">How can we create a culture of excellence in schools?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>1. Ask students what they like</h2> <p>For a start, I think we could ask students what they like. It\u2019s much easier to do better at something if you are motivated to do so, so we should encourage children to do better in subjects they\u2019re good at. I think one of the main ideas around high ability education is getting people to achieve highly in areas where they already show competency. <em>Colm O\u2019Reilly, director, <a href=\"https://www.dcu.ie/ctyi/index.shtml\">Centre for Talented Youth Ireland</a>, Dublin City University</em></p> <p>If people don\u2019t enjoy a subject, I think schools have a responsibility to raise their attainment, but to not force them to excel. Schools can do many different things to raise attainment, such as whole-school approaches to behaviour or effective pedagogy, or individual interventions such as mentoring and apps. Encouraging learners who are assessed as having high potential to explore the subjects they really love is the way to go. <em>Simon Coyle, co-founder, <a href=\"http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/\">The Brilliant Club</a></em></p> <h2><strong>2. Work out what is holding them back</strong></h2> <p>Young people can be held back by not seeing the value of the gifts they have. As parents and teachers, we have to encourage them to see the potential in their talent, where it can lead them, and the opportunities it offers them. <em>Colm O\u2019Reilly</em></p> <p>Gifted children are not good at everything. [Our assessments] show what can hold the child back: sensory issues, social and emotional issues such as perfectionism, and lack of resilience. Even the simplest thing can throw a child off course. Some children with high ability also have special needs or a disability. These children can have low self-esteem and underachieve because their needs are not recognised. <em>Denise Yates, chief executive, Potential Plus UK</em></p> <h2>3. Understand how students learn<br /></h2> <p>I don\u2019t hold with the view that all children can or should be taught in the same way. I used to support numeracy and literacy programmes for adults and it was about finding that lightbulb moment when someone says: \u201cNow I get it!\u201d That is what good teaching does. There are too many children, including high learning potential children, who are \u201csquare pegs in round holes\u201d. <em>Denise Yates</em></p> <h2>4. Incorporate games and other activities<br /></h2> <p>Games can have an enormous impact on high performance \u2013 think of the strategy needed for Monopoly, for example. Strategic thinking is essential for high performance, too. <em>Wendy Berliner, joint chief executive, Education Media Centre</em></p> <p>Using games and activities are such a powerful tool for high ability students. Learning strategy and technique is useful for bright children to apply in other areas of their lives, and activities such as the Model United Nations is a great way to teach current affairs and international relations. <em>Colm O\u2019Reilly</em></p> <h2>5. Get parents involved</h2> <p>Some children can be held back by parents who don\u2019t understand their importance as the child\u2019s first and longest-serving teacher. Parents need to have high expectations of their children if they are to do well \u2013 not unrealistic, just high. Research shows it makes the difference. <em>Wendy Berliner</em></p> <h2>6. Be open about developing growth mindsets</h2> <p>The growth mindset has proved really helpful in some schools. The term, coined by Carol Dweck, demonstrates the difference between a fixed mindset \u2013 thinking that you have a set level of ability that will determine your academic outcome \u2013 and a flexible mindset, where you can grow your intelligence. It\u2019s true that you have to be overt in doing this. Many schools now talk to students about the fact that they can grow their intelligence, but it\u2019s sometimes a bit hollow because they don\u2019t talk about how they can do this. <em>Deborah Eyre, academic researcher and founder of <a href=\"https://www.highperformancelearning.co.uk/\">High Performance Learning</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/oct/12/the-problem-of-perfectionism-five-tips-to-help-your-students\">The problem of perfectionism: five tips to help your students</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>7. Talk about the future</strong></h2> <p>I think it helps to show a child what their potential future holds if they can develop their talents, and show that this future is something that is fulfilling but also tangible. <em>Colm O\u2019Reilly</em></p> <p>It\u2019s also helpful for students to see the link between a potential future and what they need to start doing to make it possible. <em>Deborah Eyre</em></p> <p><em>Read the full Q&amp;A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/jul/27/how-do-we-boost-childrens-brainpower-live-chat\">here</a>.</em></p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuardianTeacherNetwork/\">Facebook</a>, and join the <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/agree/GTNF?returnUrl=https://teachers.theguardian.com/Registration.aspx\">Guardian Teacher Network</a> the latest articles direct to your inbox</strong></p> <p><strong>Looking for a teaching job?

          "body": "<p>Scott Kelly is a 53-year-old American astronaut and a veteran of four space flights. He retired last year after spending 11 continuous months on the International Space Station. During his time on board the ISS, he orbited the Earth 5,440 times and made three space walks. He was also part of a study with his identical twin and fellow astronaut, Mark Kelly, to examine the genetic effects of spaceflight. As Mark was on Earth and Scott in space, they made for perfect comparative analysis, though it was not the reason Kelly was chosen for the mission. He has just published a memoir, <em>Endurance: A Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery</em>.</p> <p><strong>What do you think has been the most important achievement of manned space\u00a0travel?</strong><br />I think it\u2019s how it accelerates our development of technology, whether its telecommunications, computer power, the ability to put satellites into orbit. I think we\u2019d live in a much\u00a0different world if we didn\u2019t fly\u00a0in\u00a0space.</p> <p><strong>You lost several friends in the </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/columbia\" title=\"\"><strong>2003 Columbia disaster</strong></a><strong>. And as you say, there were many warnings about the foam problem that caused the accident that went unheeded. How did you deal with that knowledge, and did it ever make you lose confidence in the supporting staff?</strong><br />It was hard \u2013 several close friends were on that mission, and I nearly ended up as the pilot myself \u2013 but you cope. Clearly it was a wake-up call for the whole organisation, but I didn\u2019t lose confidence. We adjusted our management philosophy after the accident. I had faith that Nasa would conduct a rigorous investigation, and it was obvious to me during my next mission that they were proceeding with an abundance of caution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2016/mar/02/scott-kelly-nasa-iss-space-earth-in-pictures\">Scott Kelly snaps photos of Earth and the galaxy from space \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What\u2019s the psychological and physical effect of literally coming back to Earth?</strong><br />Physically there\u2019s stiffness, swelling of my legs, rashes where my skin hasn\u2019t touched anything, nausea. In space you lose a significant amount of blood volume. You regain it when you get back very quickly but what you don\u2019t regain is the red blood cells you lost with it and that takes months to recover. That makes you feel fatigued. It\u2019s a six- to eight-month recovery. Then there\u2019s things you can\u2019t feel: bone loss, muscle loss, structural changes in my eyes. The effects of radiation at a genetic level \u2013 I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be. The psychological effect, at least for me, being in this controlled environment and being told what to do and when to do it for a year, and then coming back and not having that type of structure, it\u2019s definitely a challenge.</p> <p><strong>Do you know what the twin study of you and your brother was focused on? And have you been told about any results?</strong><br />Mostly genetic research but also cognitive studies. The research is still happening. It takes three to five years for the results to be published, so we don\u2019t really know much about the conclusions yet. The one big find so far was that my telomeres, basically these things at the end of our chromosomes that shorten with stress and age, actually ended up longer than Mark\u2019s. It\u2019s the opposite of what the scientists expected, given the challenging environment on the ISS, exposure to radiation, etc. I was already six minutes younger than Mark but, as Einstein predicted, I\u2019ve come back six minutes and 13 milliseconds younger after a year in space.</p> <p><strong>What about the sense of being cut off from humanity. You\u2019re stuck with a handful of people for months on end. Did that never torment you?</strong><br />You\u2019re connected with email and you can make phone calls and follow the news. On the one hand you\u2019re aware what\u2019s going on on Earth, but the fact that you\u2019re not on it does make you feel a little bit separate. It gives you a different perspective on our planet, which is a very beautiful oasis in our solar system, but at the same time has a lot of challenges and struggles: the environment, a lot of war and conflict and hardship.</p> <p><strong>Do you think there\u2019s a limit to how long people can physically and mentally stay up in space?</strong><br />I think it would depend on what they\u2019re doing and what you want them to do when they\u2019re done being in space. If you had no choice, you could probably live there for years. If you\u2019re going to Mars, I think that\u2019s doable. People are going to spend years in space and they\u2019ll want to get back to somewhere with gravity. There probably needs to be some kind of artificial gravity as part of the spacecraft. Going to Mars and back is not going to require artificial gravity, but if you wanted to go to the moons of Saturn some day, it probably would.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a3f0d7bdd4a32b7b92e950ad3499a18fa57b3c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a3f0d7bdd4a32b7b92e950ad3499a18fa57b3c1/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A selfie taken by Kelly while on board the International Space Station, 12 July 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A selfie taken by Kelly while on board the International Space Station, 12 July 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Kelly/Nasa via AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What does the space walk feel like?</strong><br />It\u2019s pretty crazy. Hopefully, when people get to that part of the book, it\u2019ll make them feel like they\u2019re there. I think it\u2019s like that type two kind of fun. Type one kind of fun is fun while you\u2019re doing it, like a carnival ride. Type two is fun when it\u2019s done. It\u2019s kind of like that.</p> <p><strong>On one of your previous missions, a cosmonaut became untethered during a space walk. What would have happened if he hadn\u2019t fortuitously hit an antenna that bounced him back?</strong><br />Frankly, he would have died \u2013 either from rising CO<sub>2</sub> or losing oxygen. It was a possibility I tried to avoid contemplating too much when I did it myself for the first time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With current technology, to go to the nearest Earth-like planet outside the solar system would take about 80,000 years</p> <footer> <cite>Scott Kelly</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What were the most testing aspects of your first space walk?</strong><br />Probably the sheer amount of time. Even before the walk itself, you spend weeks preparing and studying. You\u2019re in these incredibly complex suits for almost 12 hours straight \u2013 hours in advance, and then almost eight for the walk itself. They work great but can be really stiff and cumbersome. I never totally get why they call it spacewalking \u2013 you\u2019re crawling around with hands, and you\u2019re working and repairing every second. Not exactly a stroll.</p> <p><strong>It lasted many hours. Were you at any point anxious?</strong><br />Not especially. I\u2019ve had a knack for compartmentalising since my days in the navy. There are so many little tasks to take care of on a spacewalk \u2013 eight hours is barely enough time to complete everything we\u2019re assigned. So I just kept focused on what was in front of me: my gloves, the pieces of the station in front of me. I barely even looked at the Earth looming just outside my field of vision.</p> <p><strong>Do you think it\u2019s inevitable that at some point we\u2019ll have some manned space flight to Mars?</strong><br />I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s inevitable. It think it will happen. Inevitable means it has to happen. It seems to me that, despite any issues there may be with climate change and pollution, Earth is much more inhabitable than Mars, which basically has no atmosphere or oxygen or, as far as we know, forms of life. With our current technology, to go to the nearest Earth-like planet outside the solar system would take about 80,000 years. Whoever got on that spaceship, their ancestors would probably be a different species.</p> <p><strong>You say that reading </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/14/100-best-nonfiction-no-7-right-stuff-tom-wolfe\" title=\"\">Tom Wolfe\u2019s <strong><em>The Right Stuff</em></strong></a><strong> inspired you to become a pilot, which in turn led to being an astronaut. What inspired your\u00a0brother?</strong><br />Honestly, you\u2019d have to ask him. He had his life organised far earlier than I did, so he took the more traditional path to becoming a pilot and then an astronaut. Maybe he didn\u2019t need the kick I did from reading Wolfe\u2019s book. I think he was also inspired, like I was, by our families. Our grandfather, a merchant marine officer and fireboat captain, and our mother, who put in tremendous work to join the local police force. It inspired us to try the hardest thing we could manage to find.</p> <p><strong>And was there ever rivalry between you?</strong><br />Not really. Though technically it did take him two tries to get into Nasa \u2013 his first application got rejected. I sometimes remind him.</p> <p><strong>If there\u2019s one moment you could relive as an astronaut, what would it be?</strong><br />Coming back from space after a year. Just the smell after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)\" title=\"\">Soyuz</a> hatch opened.

Only about 80 such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/08/cambridge-university-library-dusts-off-rare-volumes-display\">first editions</a> were thought to have been published, with about 400 in total produced.</p> <p>Edmund Halley, the astronomer after whom the comet was named, edited the work, having encouraged Newton to produce a single text setting out his ideas. Halley paid for the printing because the Royal Society had run out of funds.</p> <p>The society retains two copies of the book, including the original manuscript on which the first print run in 1687 was based, which is described as its \u201cgreatest treasure\u201d.</p> <p>Among other ideas, the work sets out Newton\u2019s laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. The work is a \u201cbenchmark in human thought\u201d, Keith Moore, the head of the Royal Society library, has previously said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the history and development of science; it\u2019s one of the greatest books ever published. It was hugely influential in terms of applying mathematics to basic physical problems.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He linked the popularity of scientific texts with the number of people who have made their money from technology advancements. \u201cPeople who have big books these days maybe are the kinds of people who have made their money on the internet or the web ... If you have a few million quid to spend, why wouldn\u2019t you buy a copy of Principia Mathematica?</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve made your money from a really cool algorithm, you will probably appreciate Newtonian physics.\u201d</p> <p>According to Christie\u2019s, other sale highlights included nine lots of correspondence to the Marquis de Chastellux, featuring six letters by George Washington and three by Thomas Jefferson. They sold for a total of \u00a3900,000.</p>",

          "body": "<p>The premise of Kanye West\u2019s Saint Pablo tour sounds like it\u2019s based on a dare: perform an entire concert on a flying stage above the crowd. So, could he pull it off?</p> <p> There were moments in West\u2019s Toronto set that felt indelible, with the rapper/producer leaping around on his flying platform that sat above a rapturous mosh pit, bathing it in light. The man with the arena-sized ego managed to create scenes of spirited communal joy.</p> <p> West isn\u2019t the first to have dreamt up a flying stage: his collaborator Drake, his arch-nemesis Taylor Swift, and Nickelback have used smaller versions. It solves the problem of how to bring a musician closer to the fans, and recognizes that a concert hinges on how they and react and relate to one another.</p> <p> True, Saint Pablo\u2019s imagery recalls his 2014 summer festival shows, which found a masked West alone in front of a giant, monolithic screen. This tour is equally dependent on him as a central, unsupported performer, but with its stage that can tilt, bump and dip down just above fans\u2019 heads so they could nearly touch their idol when he lies down above them. It\u2019s dynamic and compelling. </p> <p>The stark, minimalist design offered a rich range of associations harnessed and tethered, West recalled at once a skyscraper construction worker (complete with industrial gloves); a prisoner battling a chain; and a Cronenberg-esque bionic human hooked up to technology with a bumpy <a href=\"http://cronenbergmuseum.tiff.net/collaborateurs_13-collaborators_13-eng.html\">umbilical cord</a>. The stage was part Blade Runner flying car (with Ridley Scott\u2019s hazy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fu7jN2_2pE\">black-and-sodium orange color scheme</a> echoed throughout the whole show), part Close Encounters of the Third Kind <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4PYI6TzqYk\">musical spaceship</a> (complete with blinding lights and fat bass synth sounds that might have shattered glass), and part Robert Wilson theatre prop.</p> <p> The show\u2019s final image could have emerged from Wilson and Philip Glass\u2019s <a href=\"https://backtotheworld.net/2012/06/14/robert-wilson-and-philip-glass-bed-from-einstein-on-the-beach-in-toronto-june-9-2012/\">Einstein on the Beach</a>: the tilted stage carries a crouching West slowly over the arena\u2019s floor, from darkness through a single spotlight, and beyond, to where he disembarks on the floor, slaps some hands and exits. It\u2019s a little grandiose and Christ-like, what with the gospel choir from Ultra Light Beam playing on repeat, but it\u2019s also unexpectedly moving. </p> <p> And when West is good, he\u2019s very, very good. He dialed down his trademark ranting (unlike the first show in Indianapolis, which found him apologizing to Nike at length, as one does) and dialed up the hits, reaching back from Jesus Walks through a triumphant Touch the Sky to a thwacking Stronger. He also ran through most of the self-obsessed psychodrama on his endlessly reworked Life of Pablo, proving a magnetic figure, celebratory, defiant and, crucially, focused. </p> <p>Implausible though it may seem, West even at times came across as an everyman, stepping out of the spotlights to the edges of the stage, and pulling on his tether as if straining against his own limitations. West may tell everyone he\u2019s a god, but he\u2019s compelling because he\u2019s all too human.</p>",

But this dark merger, and the three detected since, were invisible to conventional telescopes. </p> \n<p>This time, as the stars collided, they emitted an intense beam of gamma rays and the sky was showered with heavy elements, resolving a decades-old debate about where gold and platinum come from. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/gravitywaves-zip/giv-3902CuAwVVfaSYO5\" data-alt=\"When neutron stars collide graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/10/gravitywaves-zip/giv-3902CuAwVVfaSYO5\">When neutron stars collide graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Neutron stars are the smallest, densest stars known to exist: about 12 miles wide, with a teaspoon of neutron star material having a mass of about a billion tons. The core is a soup of pure neutrons, while the crust is smooth, solid and 10 billion times <a href=\"https://www.space.com/6682-neutron-star-crust-stronger-steel.html\">stronger than steel</a>.</p> \n<p>The 100-second hum picked up by Ligo told the story of how the two stars, each slightly heavier than the sun, approached their death. Initially separated by 200 miles, they circled each other 30 times a second. As they whirled inwards, accelerating to 2,000 orbits each second, the signal rose in pitch like a slide whistle.</p> \n<p>Two seconds later, Nasa\u2019s Fermi space telescope picked up an intense burst of gamma rays, emitted as shockwaves rushed through jets of matter funnelled out of the poles during the monumental impact of the collision.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7LcmWiclOs\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7LcmWiclOs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  This animation captures phenomena observed over nine days following the neutron star merger known as GW170817. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What happened next is uncertain.

The blob was a fireball of radioactive heavy chemical elements, known as a kilonova, that had been blown out from the collision at one fifth of the speed of light shortly after the gamma ray burst.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The wedding band on your finger or the gold watch you\u2019re wearing was most likely produced by two neutron stars colliding</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Previously, scientists had speculated that the sheer force of neutron star collisions would be enough to force extra neutrons into the nuclei of atoms, forging heavy elements like gold and platinum, but until now this idea was purely theoretical.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople have been looking for that forever,\u201d said Freise.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the first real confirmation that heavy elements such as gold, platinum and uranium are either solely or predominantly produced in binary neutron star collisions,\u201d said Reitze. \u201cThe wedding band on your finger or the gold watch you\u2019re wearing was most likely produced a billion years ago by two neutron stars colliding.

Deficiencies in the mineral content of pet food, useful dental hygiene tips and a new UV light to combat bone disease in reptiles are among the features great and small in the opening instalment, presented from London\u2019s Royal Veterinary College. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>Madeleine McCann: 10 Years On </strong><br />9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>The disappearance of the British three-year-old from Portuguese holiday resort Praia da Luz in 2007 remains an unsolved crime. With little evidence, and with jurisdictional issues hindering the inquiry, the case remains tragically unclear; mystery sightings, even rumours of child slavery, are the nightmares haunting this middle-class town of tapas and tennis coaching. Reporter Richard Bilton, a veteran of the case, looks again at the evidence. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>Second Chance Summer: Tuscany </strong><br />9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It is the penultimate week of the gentle relocation challenge following a group of strangers trying rural Italian life for size. Highlights so far have been the blossoming friendships \u2013 and maybe even possible business partnerships \u2013 among the gang. This week they\u2019re hosting their first major event in the form of an Italian wedding. Will they be able to meet the expectations of guests hoping for the genuine Tuscan experience? <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Confessions of a Junior Doctor </strong><br />9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>The NHS is by some estimates the world\u2019s fifth-biggest employer; TV producers making films about it can\u2019t be far behind. Even so, this is a compelling portrait of the NHS\u2019s overworked and underslept junior doctors. This episode visits the paediatric department of Northampton General, and introduces third-year doctor Fahim, working night shifts in the neo-natal unit: as anyone other than Superman might, he wonders if he\u2019s really up to it. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Britain\u2019s Nuclear Bomb: The Inside Story </strong><br />9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Tone is crucial in documentaries like this: however monumental the scientific achievement, the creation of these weapons should probably be regarded as a mixed blessing at best. This film gets it just about right, exploring the geopolitical background and the moral quandaries but finding room for the odd wry anecdote, too \u2013 such as the time the plutonium core of Britain\u2019s first nuke was left in a broken-down Vauxhall outside a London boozer. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Dawn of the Nazis </strong><br />9pm, National Geographic</h2> <p>This one-off special is made up from restored and colourised archival footage, putting viewers eerily on to the streets of Europe in the 1930s. Seeing the nightmare unfold for the German people, now led by a maniac with world domination in his sights, makes this hour play out like a horror film. Nobel-winning intellectuals such as Einstein \u2013 not to mention, of course, half of the Jewish population \u2013 begin to flee the country in droves. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2><strong>Midnight Sun </strong><br />10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>The final episode of a series whose gruesome despondency has always been compensated for by its visually luminous sumptuousness. Tonight, it\u2019s a race to save Eddie\u2019s intended victims, including Jenny Ann \u2013 who is about to give birth \u2013 from various watery graves, with the perpetrator himself in a pod with some of those against whom he has developed such a bitter grudge. Meanwhile, will Alain make good on his promise to help Jessika and Nadji? <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Film choice</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7c820388ab6a372f57bbe5cbee50eb261b63ae2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7c820388ab6a372f57bbe5cbee50eb261b63ae2/0_197_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Watson (second left) in The Bling Ring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Watson <em>(second left)</em> in The Bling Ring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Studiocanal/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Bling Ring (Sofia Coppola, 2013), 1.55am, Channel 4<br /></strong>The strange-but-true story of a bunch of spoilt LA teens who, in 2009, took to burgling the Hollywood mansions of celebrities including Paris Hilton \u2013 in whose home some scenes were shot.

Even said sarcastically, it is a strange insult to choose. Five years ago when he was managing Real Madrid, Mourinho approvingly cited Einstein before the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. \u201cOne day he [Einstein] said that the only mechanical force more powerful than steam, electricity and atomic energy is will,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThat Albert guy was not stupid. With will you can achieve things.\u201d</p> <p>Was he, in this case, using Einstein as a synonym for \u201cgenius\u201d? Or was it more specific than that? Is he following the more general trend of rejecting experts? Was he attacking some sort of distant boffin he imagines slaving in a lab to come up with theories to attack him? Sharp as John Giles and Christophe Dugarry may be as pundits, Einstein isn\u2019t the first word that comes to mind to describe them. It was the final line of the answer that perhaps gave the truest insight. \u201cThe new football,\u201d Mourinho said, \u201cit\u2019s full of Einsteins.\u201d The new football? What\u2019s that?

It was an acknowledgement of age, of the fact that there was an old football before that he, by implication, preferred, a time before Einsteins. He is not the swaggering young gunslinger radiating vigour and upsetting the established order any more. And that, really, is the problem with the reference to his 16-year career, as Mourinho must know. After all, nobody could really call Ars\u00e8ne Wenger \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/14/jose-mourinho-arsene-wenger-specialist-failure\" title=\"\">a specialist in failure</a>\u201d if they took the entirety of his career into account. The jibe stung because of the clear drop-off in Wenger\u2019s results over the past decade. But Mourinho, too, has seen a decline; it\u2019s not as obvious as Wenger\u2019s and he may offer circumstances in mitigation, but it is there.</p> <p>Between 2002-03 and 2009-10, Mourinho won seven league titles and two Champions Leagues; in the six seasons since he has won two league titles and no Champions Leagues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/21/efl-cup-fourth-round-draw-manchester-united-manchester-city\">EFL Cup draw: Manchester United face Manchester City, Liverpool host Spurs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is not particularly surprising. Sir Alex Ferguson and Valeriy Lobanovskyi are obvious exceptions who skew the perception, but very few managers have success at the very highest level for more than a decade. It is a difficult, tiring job that requires constant re-evaluation and evolution. The will becomes diminished. It is far too early to suggest that Mourinho is finished at the top, but the doubts are growing.</p> <p>In a world in which pressing, at the top end of club football at least, has become the dominant mode, Mourinho\u2019s preference for reactive football in big games is an outlier. It is too simple to say the game has moved on, but equally he can no longer be said to be at the cutting edge. That contributes to a general crisis of image and that impinges on his capacity to mould others to his will.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got used to him. His attacks on rivals, directors, referees and the authorities once provoked shock; now his every utterance is filtered through the recognition that he likes to play games. That is confusing because there have been times recently when he clearly has lost control of himself only for his outbursts of emotion to be treated as part of some strategy of manipulation. Either way, the impact of his public statements has been diminished; Mourinho no longer commands the narrative as he once did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f801e799fee0a4473b1cf1d5ecd7ca57671c209\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f801e799fee0a4473b1cf1d5ecd7ca57671c209/722_182_1598_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jose Mourinho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mourinho is not the swaggering young gunslinger radiating vigour and upsetting the established order any more.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, a case can be made that he no longer commands players as he once\u00a0did. Talk to those who played for him at Porto and it\u2019s like talking to members of a cult: they still regard him as a quasi-messianic figure. His reigns at Chelsea and Real Madrid, though, ended in rancour and there have already been rumblings at United.</p> <p>His greatest results have come when leading outsiders, players with points to prove, galvanising them behind a cause. It is harder to do that, perhaps, when you are in charge of the richest club in the country. And harder to do that with modern players, who for Mourinho are arguably a bigger problem in new football than the Einsteins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-losses-mount\">Scrutiny grows on Manchester United\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as losses mount up</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\" title=\"\">Paul Pogba arrived at United</a> and announced he wanted to win the Ballon d\u2019Or.

And if a player feels no great emotional commitment to a club, if he does not buy into their cause, for how long will he put up with the abrasive managerial style of\u00a0a\u00a0Mourinho?</p> <p>That, more than anything else, is what makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/20/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-criticism-luke-shaw-efl-cup-northampton\" title=\"\">Mourinho\u2019s public criticism of players</a> \u2013 three times in his past six league matches, stretching back to his final game in charge of Chelsea \u2013 such a concern.

The excitement concerns the possibility of detecting one of nature\u2019s most elusive phenomena \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/feb/12/the-hunt-for-gravitational-waves-could-be-nearing-success\">gravitational waves</a> \u2013 which could pave the way for a much better understanding of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/black-holes\">black holes</a>, neutron stars and other violent astronomical systems.</p> <p>Several new projects have been launched in the past few months to make gravitational waves the Next Big Thing in astronomy. Rumours have it that one of these \u2013 the US\u2019s Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced Ligo) \u2013 already \u201cdetected something\u201d in September, but the scientists involved remain tight-lipped. Time will tell.</p> <p>The search for gravitational waves goes back to the dark days of the first world war. In 1915, as Europe was engulfed in carnage, science took a great leap forward. In a series of four lectures delivered at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin in November and December, Einstein presented a new theory of gravitation, replacing that of Isaac Newton, which had endured for two and half centuries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/01/lisa-pathfinder-set-to-launch-paving-way-for-discovery-of-gravitys-secrets\">LISA Pathfinder set to launch, paving way for discovery of gravity's secrets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Called the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/jun/23/the-genesis-and-renaissance-of-general-relativity\">general theory of relativity</a>, it has been described as one of the greatest intellectual achievements in history. What makes general relativity distinctive is that it treats gravitation not as a force between bodies such as the sun and the Earth, but as a warping or distortion in the geometry of space and time. This huge conceptual reorientation, plus the sheer mathematical beauty of the theory, ensured that general relativity acquired both a mystique and a fearsome reputation for impenetrability that made Einstein a byword for genius.</p> <p>But however elegant a scientific theory may be, it is worthless if it cannot predict something new. Einstein did indeed make some predictions, but the distinctive effects he described were truly tiny. One of them is created by the spacewarp near the sun. A star beam passing close to the solar surface will be slightly bent as it traces a path through the curved geometry there. An observer on Earth will see an extremely slight displacement in the position of the star when the sun passes near it in the sky.</p> <p>The so-called \u201cbending of light effect\u201d was tested by the English astronomer Arthur Eddington in 1919 during a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919\">solar eclipse</a>, when the sun\u2019s glare was blotted out, enabling nearby stars to be seen. Eddington\u2019s delicate measurements triumphantly agreed with the predictions of general relativity. It was this experiment more than any other that, almost overnight, transformed Einstein into an international celebrity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Interferometers need to spot changes equivalent to the width of a human hair in the distance to the nearest star</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>General relativity is based on a system of equations notoriously hard to solve, but shortly after Einstein set out his new theory he produced a particular solution to his equations describing an unusual form of waves that travel across space at the speed of light. Unlike light, however \u2013 or any electromagnetic radiation \u2013 gravitational waves are literally ripples in the fabric of space-time itself.</p> <p>What does this enigmatic description mean? In operational terms it is easy to visualise. Because gravitation is a warping of geometry, when a gravitational wave crosses a region of space it stretches distances in one direction and shrinks them in a perpendicular direction, in an oscillating fashion. If such a wave passes through matter \u2013 for example, the Earth \u2013 it should squash and stretch it periodically, and so set the planet vibrating. Easy to spot, surely?</p> <p>The trouble is that, once again, the predicted effects are unbelievably small. The basic reason for this feebleness can be traced back to the sheer weakness of gravitation: electricity is a thousand trillion trillion trillion times stronger, which is why electromagnetic waves are commonplace, but gravitational waves were sidelined for decades as a mere curiosity. But in the 1960s a handful of physicists began to wonder whether they could actually be detected in the laboratory. In principle this is very simple: just look for otherwise unexplained tremors in a chunk of matter. In practice it\u2019s not so easy, because the world is filled with noise and vibration.</p> <p>After experimenting for some years, researchers settled on lasers as the best way to go. By reflecting a laser beam off a mirror, any slight changes in the distance to the mirror caused by the passage of a gravitational wave should show up in the quality of the light. The arrangement is known as an interferometer. The US has two 4km-sized laser interferometer gravitational observatories and Europe has one, <a href=\"http://www.ego-gw.it/public/about/whatIs.aspx\">Virgo, located near Pisa</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/feb/12/the-hunt-for-gravitational-waves-could-be-nearing-success\">The hunt for gravitational waves could be nearing success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Ligo and Virgo operated successfully for several years, but no gravitational waves were detected: not really surprising, given the vibrations being sought are smaller than the size of an atomic nucleus over several kilometres. A striking comparison is that the interferometers need to spot changes equivalent to the width of a human hair in the distance to the nearest star. How likely is it to succeed, and for the substance of those September rumours to be confirmed? If a supernova occurred in our galaxy tomorrow, Advanced Ligo would detect it as a short but intense burst of gravitational waves. But such events are rare and one may not occur this century.</p> <p>Alternatively, one could observe a pair of neutron stars or black holes \u2013 both massive but highly compact objects \u2013 in close orbit. As the stars cavort around each other at high speed, they serve as a prolific source of gravitational waves, draining the system of energy. This causes the stars to go into a death spiral, ending in a titanic collision and creating a single black hole. Ligo and Virgo aspire to routinely detect such events far beyond the confines of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, in order to study the fine details of the objects\u2019 violent demise and turbulent aftermath.</p> <p>The main motivation for gravitational wave detectors, however, is not to test Einstein\u2019s theory one more time, welcome though that would be. Conventional telescopes detect light or radio waves, and satellites have extended the range across the entire electromagnetic spectrum; gravitational observatories, however, would probe an entirely new spectrum, enabling the study of astronomical phenomena, such as neutron star coalescence, that are inaccessible in any other way. And because gravitational waves are so penetrating, they could enable us to peer into regions of space obscured from normal view by gas and dust, such as the environment around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/27/supermassive-black-hole-rotate-speed-light\">supermassive black holes</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/08/einstein-inspired-by-james-clerk-maxwell\">Einstein inspired by James Clerk Maxwell | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ground-based interferometers are not the only way to study gravitational waves. Ambitious plans are afoot to put an interferometer into space to detect very long waves from much larger astronomical systems such as supermassive black holes. A first step towards <a href=\"http://lisa.nasa.gov/\">Lisa (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)</a> was taken with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/01/lisa-pathfinder-set-to-launch-paving-way-for-discovery-of-gravitys-secrets\">last week\u2019s launch</a> of a satellite to test key aspects of the technology.</p> <p>As always in science, there is potential for a prize as yet unknown. For history has shown that every time the universe is studied with a new type of instrument, unexpected discoveries are made. Gravitational waves are created by any massive rapidly moving objects, from stars and black holes to the big bang itself. With Advanced Ligo up and running, and Advanced Virgo about to launch, it would be highly fitting if the first definitive detection of gravitational waves were to coincide with the centenary of general relativity. The universe is sure to spring surprises: this could yet prove to be Einstein\u2019s greatest gift.</p>",

Since the apparent plateau happened at a time when the reservoir of healthy centenarians was expanding, scientists concluded that an intrinsic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/17/violet-brown-jamaican-oldest-person-117-emma-morano\">biological limit had been reached</a>: even if you evade accidents and disease, your body will still steadily decline until it passes the point of no return, the data appeared to suggest.</p> <p>Jan Vijg, a geneticist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who led this research, said: \u201cWe simply provided evidence that humans do indeed have a ceiling that they really cannot go beyond. That\u2019s part of being human.\u201d</p> <p>There will be the occasional outlier \u2013 the French supercentenarian and oldest woman to have lived, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997, but most of us have a shorter intrinsic \u201cshelf life\u201d. The probability of someone living to 146 is infinitesimal, Vijg said. \u201cIf somebody told you that they saw a UFO yesterday but it\u2019s gone now, you\u2019d probably be polite, but you wouldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Vijg. \u201cThat\u2019s my reaction with this story.\u201d</p> <p>Before resigning yourself to the knowledge that you will almost certainly expire by the time you reach 115 years, it is worth noting that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/unsolvedmysteries/story/0,,1155662,00.html\">this ceiling could be moveable in the future</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/28/internal-clock-makes-some-people-age-quicker-and-die-younger-regardless-of-lifestyle\">Internal 'clock' makes some people age faster and die younger \u2013 regardless of lifestyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richard Faragher, professor of biogerontology at the University of Brighton, puts it this way: <strong>\u201c</strong>How long can a human live if you don\u2019t do anything to them? Probably around 120. But there is a separate question, how long do people last if you can do something to them?\u201d</p> <p>Until now, the steady increase in average life expectancy (as distinct from lifespan) has been driven by fewer people smoking, better nutrition and antibiotics. Drugs and surgery for heart disease and cancer have also played a part.</p> <p>However, scientists are only just beginning to explore the possibility of therapies designed to target the process of ageing itself, as well as the illnesses that come with advancing years. This field has recently taken an intriguing twist, as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/28/internal-clock-makes-some-people-age-quicker-and-die-younger-regardless-of-lifestyle\">evidence has emerged</a> that ageing is not simply the manifestation of environmental wear and tear. Instead, the latest work suggests that ageing is at least partly driven by an internal genetic clock that actively causes our cells and organs to grind to a halt.</p> <p>This raises the intriguing possibility that ageing could be slowed or even reversed, and some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/15/ageing-process-may-be-reversible-scientists-claim\">animal studies have already claimed to do just this.</a> </p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t argue that the ceiling is unmoveable,\u201d said Vijg. \u201cBut trying to say what the age limit is, science can\u2019t yet say, it\u2019s predicting the future.\u201d</p>",

A new exhibition dedicated to her work opens on Saturday in St Leonards-on-Sea near Hastings, before coming to the Art Bermondsey Project Space in London in late June.</p> <p>The show at the <a href=\"http://www.lucy-bell.com/\" title=\"\">Lucy Bell Gallery </a>features 67-year-old images remastered from damaged originals by the renowned darkroom printer Robin Bell. Many of the photographs highlight the poverty in 1950s Paris, where Stafford was living with her first husband, a British foreign correspondent. In the poor quarters of Bastille and Boulogne-Billancourt, Stafford found street children living around the notorious slums of Cit\u00e9 Lesage-Bullourde, now the site of the Paris Opera Bastille.</p> <p>Other photographs in the show follow the development of Stafford\u2019s photo-documentary approach to fashion shoots. She took the models out on to the boulevards and squares. \u201cFashion photography was a double-edged thing,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the one hand it was marvellous, all the beauty of the designs and the fabrics was delightful.

Either I was sent out on assignment and did what I had to do, or I instigated my own projects. My particular interest was to see humanitarian issues through my camera and draw attention to them. The picture I loved most is of a refugee mother holding this poor little infant. That image meant more than anything else. I wanted to do a story about the refugees. I believe that documentary work should raise social issues, and was very happy when other photographers and journalists were commissioned to go out and record the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up during the Depression in America, Stafford was aware, she said, not just of the poverty of hungry migrants from the Dust Bowl, but also of those fleeing Germany to safety before the second world war.</p> <p>\u201cI congratulate myself for surviving so long, but I have never put myself in positions of real danger. I was very friendly with Bob Capa, and once he suggested that I go to work with Chim, the working name of another Magnum photographer, David Seymour, as an assistant. But I knew he was a war correspondent, so I said I would not go. And, of course, both of them were killed covering conflicts.\u201d</p> <p>Stafford has launched <a href=\"http://fotodocument.org/fotoreportage-award/\" title=\"\">an award in her name for young female photographers</a>. \u201cThe object is to give women a little bit of money towards building up a photo essay that addresses important issues. I am doing it in conjunction with the arts organisation FotoDocument [submissions by 26 May],\u201d Stafford said. \u201cLife has been good to me, so I felt I should try to give something back. When I started out it was very hard for a woman in Fleet Street, and I am sure, although it has improved, that that is still true.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>It\u2019s a total fluke. No one was thinking about making the most precise test yet of general relativity when the Soyuz rocket lifted off from French Guiana on 22 August 2014. The European Space Agency was launching Galileo 5 and 6, a pair of navigation satellites to break Europe\u2019s reliance on the American GPS system.</p> <p>At first everything appeared to be going well. The rocket cleared the launch pad and sped away from the surrounding rain forest on its way to space. But trouble was brewing inside the rocket\u2019s upper stage, the final motor that would put the satellites into their operational orbit.</p> <p>A pipe containing frigid liquid helium had been placed <a href=\"http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/galileo/Galileo_Sav_flyer_j15_low-res.pdf\">too close to a fuel line</a>. The fuel froze, stopping the upper stage from manoeuvring correctly and placing the brace of satellites in the wrong orbit.<br /></p> <p>Instead of a circular path, they followed elliptical orbits from 13,713 km up to 25,900 km and back down again. Using onboard thrusters, the satellites were manoeuvred into somewhat less elliptical orbits and a team of specialists is now studying whether this will allow them to be used for their intended navigation purposes. Even if not, the satellites are far from a complete write-off.<br /></p> <p>They continue to orbit Earth twice every day, changing their altitude by 8500 km on each circulation. As luck would have it, this makes them perfect for a world leading test of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.<br /></p> <p>Devised 100 years ago this month, general relativity is a theory of gravity. One of its mind-bending predictions is that time will pass more slowly in a gravitational field. In other words, clocks on Earth \u2018tick\u2019 more slowly than clocks in space.<br /></p> <p>This was demonstrated on 18 June 1976 by the American space probe <a href=\"http://funphysics.jpl.nasa.gov/technical/grp/grav-probea.html\">Gravity Probe-A</a>, which was lobbed to an altitude of 10,000 km before it fell back to Earth. Although in space for just under two hours, its transmissions showed that the highly accurate clock on board had sped up.<br /></p> <p>Now, such clocks are routinely used on global navigation satellites because their signals have to be corrected for these effects. They speed up by a few tenths of a microsecond every day. If not taken into account, this would <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Galileo_satellites_set_for_year-long_Einstein_experiment\">cause navigation errors of around 10 km per day</a>.<br /></p> <p>The remaining elliptical orbits of Galileo 5 and 6 mean that their onboard clocks will continuously sweep through weakening and strengthening parts of Earth\u2019s gravitational field as they orbit to and fro. This will continuously affect the rates of the clocks in a way that can be predicted by theory and measured from the satellites\u2019 signals.</p> <p>At the end of the year-long experiment, scientists from the <a href=\"https://www.zarm.uni-bremen.de/\">ZARM Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity</a>, Germany, and <a href=\"https://syrte.obspm.fr/spip/\">SYRTE Syst\u00e8mes de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence Temps-Espace</a>, France, expect to have measured this time dilation to four times the accuracy of previous experiments.</p> <p>Continually testing Einstein\u2019s predictions is the key to making progress in gravitational physics. There is reason to believe that gravity behaves subtly differently in extremely strong gravitational fields such as those found close to black holes. If so, minuscule variations from relativity\u2019s predictions could be seen in the wider universe. So, physicists are always on the look out for a new way to test Einstein\u2019s ideas.<br /></p> <p>Scientists often talk about serendipity when accidentally discovering new phenomena that they were not actually looking for. This story shows that the same can happen with spacecraft operations.<br /></p> <p>And in the centenary year of the general relativity\u2019s formulation, think of it as an anniversary present.<br /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com\">Stuart Clark</a><em> is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Unknown-Universe-About-Chapters/dp/1781855749/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0\">The Unknown Universe</a><em> (Head of Zeus), and co-host of the podcast </em><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-388589543/the-stuniverse-podcast-episode?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=facebook\">The Stuniverse</a><em> (</em><a href=\"http://www.bingofilms.co.uk\">Bingo Productions</a><em>).

However, Work had hoped to convince the court of appeal judges to allow him to join those few men who had been granted more than half of the combined assets in a divorce in recognition of the \u201cwholly exceptional nature\u201d of their success. </p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of advertising firm WPP, was awarded 60% of joint assets in his 2005 divorce from Sandra, his wife of 33 years. In 2014, a judge granted the ex-wife of Chris Hohn, the billionaire founder of hedge fund The Children\u2019s Investment Fund, 36% of their $1.5bn fortune. </p> <p>Holman had ruled that although Work was an \u201castute businessman\u201d, Gray was a \u201chighly intelligent\u201d woman who had given up her career to follow her husband to Tokyo, where he made hundreds of millions of pounds exploiting the Japanese financial crisis. </p> <p>\u201cA successful claim to a special contribution requires some exceptional and individual quality in the spouse concerned. Being in the right place at the right time or benefiting from a period of boom is not enough,\u201d Holman said. </p> <p>\u201cIt may one day fall for consideration whether a very highly paid footballer, who is very good at his job but may be no more skilful than past greats, such as Stanley Matthews or Bobby Charlton, makes a special contribution or is merely the lucky beneficiary of the colossal payments now made possible by the sale of television rights.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"490596de21f0f33fadaaf3341a8d4f4b403ba990\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/490596de21f0f33fadaaf3341a8d4f4b403ba990/0_169_2348_2348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy Gray, who split up with Work in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy Gray, who split up with Work in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Holman said Work and Gray, 47, had been \u201ctwo strong and equal partners\u201d and he would not have been able to amass his vast fortune without her contribution. </p> <p>The pair, who are both American and have two teenage children, met in 1992 and married in 1995.

          "body": "<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, two massive collapsed stars \u2013 known as black holes \u2013 collided. The resulting explosion created ripples in the fabric of spacetime. Known as gravity waves, those ripples reached Earth on 14 September last year, where they were picked up by a pair of detectors known as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (Ligo).</p> <p>It was an astronomical first. After decades of effort, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/11/gravitational-waves-discovery-hailed-as-breakthrough-of-the-century\" title=\"\">scientists had finally detected gravitational waves</a>, whose existence Albert Einstein had predicted, with some hesitation, in 1915 in his Theory of General Relativity. Not surprisingly, the detection has been hailed as a scientific milestone and made headlines round the world. If nothing else, this was surely the final vindication, a century on, of the great man\u2019s genius.</p> <p>But there is more to the discovery, for this is also a story of remarkable scientific pig-headedness and resolve, one that has much in common with Samuel Johnson\u2019s acerbic view of remarriage being a triumph of hope over experience. Certainly scientists could not be accused of being faint-hearted. For the past 30 years, new gravitational wave detectors were built, but failed to pinpoint any hint of these extra-galactic signals. So scientists and engineers simply returned to the drawing board and refined their instruments \u2013 to try again, only to fail once more.</p> <p>In 1998 I interviewed Professor Jim Hough of Glasgow University\u2019s physics department about his work on the Geo-600 gravitational wave detector, the UK-German collaboration that had just been built outside Hanover. Hough has been hunting gravitational waves since 1970 and at the time was quietly confident that this latest machine would soon hit pay dirt. \u201cWe should spot gravitational waves by 2001,\u201d he confidently told me at the time. It transpires that he was 15 years out.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time, we thought that supernovae \u2013 exploding stars \u2013 would produce gravitational waves that would be fairly easily detectable,\u201d Hough says today. \u201cThen the theorists decided they probably didn\u2019t produce detectable gravitational waves. So we had to make our instruments even more sensitive so that we could pick up waves from more esoteric events, such as collisions of neutron stars or black holes.\u201d</p> <p>This proved to be a distinctly tricky task, however. Gravitational waves may be generated by enormously energetic events but these are also incredibly remote. As a result, a wave\u2019s energy is dissipated to a tiny fraction of its original magnitude by the time it reaches Earth and produces a shift of a only few hundred billion-billionths of a metre in a detector\u2019s instruments.</p> <p>It sounds an improbably tiny measurement to make. In fact, the process is relativity straightforward. A detector has tunnels running along two long arms (on Ligo they stretch for 4km) and an identical beam of light tuned to a single wavelength is shone down each of them. At the end is a mirror that reflects the beams back down the tunnel to a central detector, where they are recombined so that their wavelengths are kept in step. In other words, the beams\u2019 light waves peak together, producing a bright spot.</p> <p>However, if the mirrors\u2019 positions are moved very slightly \u2013 by, for instance, a gravitational wave changing the length of one arm more than the other \u2013 a peak on one beam will coincide with a trough in the other beam and the image will be darkened.</p> <p>The trouble is that gravitational waves are not the only types of vibration that can affect a detector. If a person walks close to one of its mirrors, his or her mass will be sufficient to exert a tiny gravitational influence on it, causing the mirror to shift. In the case of Geo-600, there is the problem of the North Sea. The coast is more than 100km away. Nevertheless, the waves pounding on that distant shore create a clear signal for its delicate instruments. Fortunately that signal is a highly rhythmic one and can be removed from the machine\u2019s output.</p> <p>Far more pernicious is the problem of thermal noise \u2013 the heat of the apparatus itself. This causes mirrors and mountings to vibrate slightly, again creating spurious signals. Dealing with this issue has pushed the ingenuity of gravitational wave scientists to its limits and has involved the development of delicate systems of mirrors and pendulums made from pure silica. This system eliminates most of the thermal vibrations that have bedevilled detectors in the past.</p> <p>The silica set-up developed at Geo-600 uses four platforms suspended from each other in layers like a giant, shiny mobile. This eradicates virtually all vibrations. \u201cIt is the scientific equivalent of the best crystal glassware,\u201d says Hough\u2019s colleague Professor Sheila Rowan.</p> <p>The system was developed with input from a team of scientists from Glasgow, Strathclyde and Birmingham universities and from the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory near Didcot in Oxfordshire, and was the final component of the sensationally successfully upgrade of Ligo. Scientists at the Ligo labs \u2013 one based at Hanford in the US\u2019s Pacific north-west and the other in Livingston, Louisiana \u2013 had begun hunting for gravitational waves in 2002. The two detectors found nothing and were switched off in 2010. A $200m upgrade involved fitting them with new features that included the silica mirrors that British scientists had helped develop.</p> <p>Within weeks, the machines hit pay dirt. In September last year, both detected gravitational waves that have since been shown to come from two massive black holes colliding 1.3 billion light years from Earth. \u201cWe did it. This was truly a scientific moonshot. We landed on the Moon,\u201d said David Reitze, executive director of Ligo.</p> <p>It should also be noted that, this time, Hough had been remarkably prescient in anticipating the discovery. \u201cWe should see gravitational waves, probably in an American machine fitted with our devices, by around 2015,\u201d he told me in a 2012 interview. And that, of course, is exactly what has occurred.</p> <p>The elation with which this discovery has been greeted is understandable though we should be clear how it came about. The theoretical framework that explains gravitational waves is old: it was outlined by Einstein in 1915 in his Theory of General Relativity. Neither is the basic detection method new: it was in use 20 years ago.</p> <p>What changed the state of the playing field was the involvement of teams of scientists from different disciplines and several nations, including Britain, Germany and the US, who combined their talents to find ways to eliminate all the spurious signals that were blocking detection of gravitational waves. This massive clearing-up exercise involved lots of people: materials scientists, who developed those delicate silica mirrors that removed the thermal vibrations; geologists, who played a key role in the understanding of seismic events that affected detectors; and laser scientists, who created the special stable beams now used in these machines.</p> <p>The commitment, the level of collaboration and the diligence and determination displayed by these hunters of gravitational waves is startling, and a gratifying indication of what can be achieved by big science. For decades, new headaches and problems beset the quest for gravity waves, but, with remarkable singlemindedness, they have been swatted aside.</p> <p>We should record a note of caution, of course, one sounded by astronomer Gerry Gilmore of Cambridge University. \u201cGravitational waves are \u2018classical\u2019 physics that are related to the mere 5% of the universe that is made of ordinary matter,\u201d he points out. \u201cWe still have the nature of reality to discover. So let\u2019s be excited but remain humble. We do indeed know more and more, but it is still all about very little. There is the issue of discovering the make-up of dark matter, for example.\u201d</p> <p>The Ligo result is still a remarkable discovery, of course, but what comes next? There are many answers to this question, it transpires. For a start, it is now clear that astronomers have created a new type of astronomy: gravitational wave observation.</p> <p>Until now, everything we have learned about the universe has been based on studies of electromagnetic radiation \u2013 from infrared to visible light to gamma rays. Gravitational waves are going to give us a new way of looking at the universe. Indeed, they have already thrown up one unexpected finding. That burst of gravitational waves detected by Ligo shows they were produced by a collision of one black hole \u2013 a collapsed star that was 35 times the mass of our sun \u2013 with another that was slightly smaller.</p> <p>\u201cWe were confident about the existence of small black holes a few times the mass of the sun, and about very, very large ones,\u201d says Hough. \u201cBut this confirms the existence of a range of intermediate black holes, about which we had theoretical doubts. Now those have gone. We\u2019re already going places.\u201d</p>",

Perhaps it is less of a problem in the US.</p> <p>Many of <a href=\"http://lagosconvo.com/rants/epic-fail-17-times-donald-trump-failed-basic-spelling/\">Trump\u2019s tweets have been wildly misspelled</a>, and he came up with a glorious macaronic on 17 December when he described the Chinese seizure of an unmanned US drone as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/17/donald-trump-china-unpresidented-act-us-navy-drone\">\u201cunpresidented act\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f054a77b100fca1636c94d46ef5e5b75ac1a26b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f054a77b100fca1636c94d46ef5e5b75ac1a26b/0_0_621_323/500.png\" alt=\"Trump's misspelled China tweet\" width=\"500\" height=\"260\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump\u2019s latest public misspelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This fuses, with James Joycean virtuosity, into a neologistic lexical alloy: first, it has never happened before; second, it won\u2019t happen again after \u201cBarrack\u201d (as Trump misspells it \u2013 has he not read Obama\u2019s birth certificate?) makes way for a real president.</p> <p>Of course, paramount leaders need not be of spelling-bee-ace quality. Gordon Brown, in April 2009, wrote a handwritten, 70-word letter of apology to an aggrieved Nadine Dorries splattered with misspellings, including the addressee\u2019s surname (\u201cDorres\u201d), \u201cpolitcal\u201d, \u201cknowlege\u201d, \u201cembarassment\u201d and \u201cadvizer\u201d. The letter also revealed that Brown has impenetrable handwriting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2009/may/01/gordon-brown-dyslexia-spelling\">which is often used to cover for dyslexia</a>; the odd guessed-at-but-wrong spelling can be tactically camouflaged. There is a lot of it about. Between 5% and 10% of the population do this, according to one report.</p> <p>Want to know what it is like being dyslexic? Try spelling dyslexic backwards in five seconds. Personally, I don\u2019t have any difficulty and I have worked out why: I can visualise words in my active and passive vocabulary printed out on a screen \u2013 usually in 25-point Times New Roman. Spelling backwards, right to left, is easy. Some of us, however, don\u2019t have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/18/pictures-trigger-memories-faster-than-words-neuroscientist\">top-notch visual memory</a>.</p> <p>What has been proved is that there is no correlation between dyslexia and intelligence. In fact, Maryanne Wolf at Tufts University, whose lab investigates it, suggests that there may be an inverse relationship.</p> <p>Wolf\u2019s thesis is borne out by consolatory websites that inform people with dyslexia that they are not alone. F Scott Fitzgerald misspelled his friend\u2019s name as Ernest Hemmingway. Hemingway himself couldn\u2019t spell for nuts. Neither could Einstein. Even Shakespeare signed his name in at least six ways.</p> <p>This is a serious issue. Why don\u2019t we make a serious effort to rid our language of embedded archaeological debris? Spell it like it sounds. Why shouldn\u2019t we write what we say \u2013 \u201cguvment\u201d instead of \u201cgovernment\u201d?</p> <p>It would save time educationally and spare pain (and demotion) to those who, however intensively they are taught, will never spell correctly.</p> <p>I hope to God, for all of our sakes, that Trump is, indeed, dyslexic and not that other, awful D-word.</p>",

American pop art can be dated from the moment he started painting a stars and stripes flag over collaged news stories in 1954. Minimalism starts there too, or maybe his monochrome 1955 version.

As for Dal\u00ed, where to begin? His paintings include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/28/the-10-best-works-of-erotic-art#img-8\">The Great Masturbator</a> (1929), whose title is self-explanatory, and his confessions of depravity even shocked his surrealist comrades. This is a marriage made in art heaven: the genius of Duchamp should shine a light on Dali\u2019s deconstructions of aesthetic beauty, while Dali\u2019s wickedness will free Duchamp from the academic theorists who hold him prisoner. </p> <ul> <li>7 October-3 January, Royal Academy, London.</li> </ul> <h2>Arp: The Poetry of Forms</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd1b932e4d37e385d4b3451d5f00a041cb6a8d12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd1b932e4d37e385d4b3451d5f00a041cb6a8d12/1424_897_3775_3774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hommage \u00e0 Rodin, 1938, by Jean Arp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hommage \u00e0 Rodin, 1938, by Jean Arp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Adlard/Private Collection, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the age of Brexit, an exhibition of this sculptor who transcended Europe\u2019s borderlines is a timely reminder of how art can defy national boundaries. Arp (1886-1966) called himself either Hans or Jean depending on whether he was speaking German or French. He came from the disputed region of Alsace-Lorraine, so it was a moot point. In the first world war, he escaped to the neutral polyglot Swiss city of Zurich where he helped found dadaism.

It\u2019s amazing she has never won the Turner prize (she was shortlisted in 2006). Then again, perhaps an artist whose most celebrated work, Helmut Crumb, combines the styles of two of the most sexist artists going will always strike some people as lacking radical seriousness. Which is a shame because Warren has helped put sculpture \u2013 as opposed to readymade objects \u2013 back into the mainstream of contemporary art. </p> <ul> <li>14 October-7 January, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-st-ives/exhibition/rebecca-warren\">Tate St Ives</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future</h2> <p>Of all the exhibitions that have marked this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/12/revolution-russian-art-1917-1932-review\">centenary of the October Revolution</a>, this is the most exciting.

It is astonishing to see how early he was deconstructing the very idea of portraiture in paintings from the 1880s that ask who we really see when we look in the mirror.

The artists who would first exhibit as impressionists in 1874 fled to London to escape the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. While in Britain, they painted views of the city and its suburbs whose vitality and freshness put homegrown Victorian art to shame.

It\u2019s true that the naked paintings at the heart of this show got him into trouble with the Paris police in 1917.

If a star crosses the event horizon it would simple wink out, like a light being turned off.</p> <p>However, if something halted the formation of the black hole, then there would be a solid surface for the star to strike.

Those three words explain so much of what has been happening in this country. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/13/steve-king-somebody-elses-babies-iowa-racist\">Steve King defends 'somebody else's babies' remark despite backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>King had been tweeting his support for Geert Wilders, a far-right Dutch politician who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-boosted-by-spat-with-turkey-as-election-nears\">being closely watched in the Netherlands elections</a> on Wednesday. Wilders calls Moroccan immigrants \u201cscum\u201d and has proposed banning the Qur\u2019an, taxing hijabs and closing mosques throughout the Netherlands. Bigots embolden other bigots. Donald Trump has done this favor to racists across the globe \u2013 now others are doing the same. </p> <p>During the controversy that greeted his tweet, King denied that his comment was about race but insisted that it was about \u201cwestern civilization\u201d \u2013 a term <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/steve-king-white-people-republican-convention\">he\u2019d clarified in July</a>, on an MSNBC panel. Back then, he had questioned the contributions made by any \u201csubgroup\u201d to a culture rooted in \u201cwestern Europe, eastern Europe and the United States of America and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world. That\u2019s all of western civilization.\u201d</p> <p>But where would our civilization be without algebra (invented by the Arabs)? Or without Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, without Albert Einstein, without tacos and baklava, without Toni Morrison and James Baldwin, without Miles Davis, without blues and jazz? Where would our culture be without the countless inventions and innovations that immigrants and people of color have made to every aspect of our daily lives, to our health, our happiness, our welfare? <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>It\u2019s maddening to have to list the contributions made by our non-white, non-US born communities. But it\u2019s an argument we\u2019ve been obliged to make before. Saul Bellow, among our most respected American novelists, asked, in an interview, \u201cWho is the Tolstoy of the Zulus? The Proust of the Papuans?\u201d and later complained: \u201cWe can\u2019t open our mouths without being denounced as racists, misogynists, supremacists, imperialists or fascists.\u201d</p> <p>But King has shown no interest in clarifying or modifying his statement, as Bellow did. In fact, King took it farther. And it\u2019s those three words \u2013 \u201csomeone else\u2019s babies\u201d \u2013 that appall those of us who might have hoped that public discourse could not possibly get much uglier. No matter how mindlessly King prattles on about western civilization, it\u2019s clear whose babies he considers to be \u201csomeone else\u2019s.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Let us picture neonatal units in urban hospitals, where babies of every color are sleeping, stretching, being fed, adjusting to this chilly, noisy, bright new world. Is King suggesting that we deport the brown and black babies \u2013 who will do nothing to \u201crestore\u201d our civilization and who will dilute our \u201cpure\u201d gene pool \u2013 and only allow the white infants to develop into productive citizens? <br /></p> <p>I\u2019ve heard people say that they don\u2019t like babies, but most of us agree that we\u2019re moved and entertained by them: by their innocence, their playfulness, their cuteness, their faces and personalities already hinting at the adults they will become. What did these babies do, on their short time on earth, to deserve such enmity, such heartlessness?</p> <p>One of our most basic duties as human beings \u2013 as animals, in fact \u2013 is to protect our young, to nurture and help them survive. But Steve King (and his supporters) seem not to understand this; to him, the only babies we should welcome into this world are those who look like us, whose skin is white.</p> <p>This is the kind of thinking we find at play in the recent wave of hate crimes. The men behind those attacks could not have believed that their victims had once been babies whose mothers loved them. The teenage girl who videotaped her father being arrested by Ice agents in Los Angeles was someone else\u2019s baby \u2013 in fact, the baby of the dad who was being dragged away. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Conservatives against immigration say we can\u2019t admit everyone who wants to enter our country. What about our national security? they ask. Lost in this debate is the fact that we are talking about human beings. Humans who wouldn\u2019t have left their homes and everything they cared about unless they felt they had to, unless they had no choice but to leave in order to escape poverty and crime. <br /></p> <p>They love their parents and children. Their babies are precious, vulnerable, full of potential. They mourn their dead and are grief-stricken when their loved ones\u2019 tombstones are defaced. <br /></p> <p>In Wild Swans, Jung Chang\u2019s eloquent memoir about the lives of three generations of women in China, she quotes a saying of Confucius: \u201cImagine my heart was yours!\u201d It\u2019s as good a piece of advice as any I\u2019ve heard, and it\u2019s painful to realize that men like Steve King can\u2019t see past the skin color \u2013 of a baby! \u2013 to imagine the heart (like his, like ours) softly beating within. </p>",

This coup, claimed McDonnell, \u201cis being perpetrated by an alliance between elements in the Labour party and the Murdoch media empire, both intent on destroying Jeremy Corbyn and all that he stands for\u201d. But the truth is that not everyone who wants Corbyn out is a Blairite stooge, or in thrall to Rupert Murdoch: the latest ally of the Progress Putsch is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/07/stephen-hawking-jeremy-corbyn-disastrous-labour-resign\" title=\"\">Stephen Hawking</a>.</p> <p>This, to remind you, is the man who said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here today if not for the NHS\u201d, and warned that the NHS \u201cmust be preserved from commercial interests who want to privatise it\u201d. He has also pointed out that inequality is one of the biggest threats to the planet. Sentiments not so far from those of a certain Islington MP. Not exactly the rightwing ideologue of McDonnell\u2019s imagination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/07/stephen-hawking-jeremy-corbyn-disastrous-labour-resign\">Stephen Hawking: Jeremy Corbyn is a disaster for Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But we now have a Labour party where more Corbyn supporters think a short speech by Tony Blair caused the defeat in Copeland than believe their leader had anything to do with it. In that context it will be interesting to see McDonnell\u2019s statement about Hawking\u2019s comments. Perhaps the Russians who hacked the EU referendum and the presidential race have somehow found their way into Hawking\u2019s speech synthesizer? Or maybe the \u201cMSM\u201d, the mainstream media, has twisted Hawking\u2019s words, and he\u2019s actually branch chair of Physicists for Jezza?</p> <p>A constant feature of the current leadership of the Labour party is to blame anyone but Corbyn for the party\u2019s failures. But maybe, when one of the smartest people in the world claims that Corbyn is a \u201cdisaster for the Labour party\u201d, and when Owen Jones, a journalist long seen as Corbyn\u2019s biggest ally in the media, says it would be hard to vote for him were there another leadership election, the thing to do isn\u2019t it decry the critics as red Tories, the thing to do is to listen. We are approaching a point where the strongest critics of Corbyn are not the Conservatives, most of whom can\u2019t believe their luck that he\u2019s clung on so long. No, Corbyn\u2019s detractors are increasingly those who originally supported him: people who care immensely about the NHS, people who are most invested in getting Labour into power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/01/corbyn-staying-not-good-enough\">Jeremy Corbyn says he\u2019s staying.

Apparently, door-knockers in Stoke had noticed that the more they mentioned Corbyn, the more likely it was that the person on the other side of the door would slam it in their face. Another friend who has been a Labour member for years tells me they have given up canvassing by phone because, more often than not, any mention of Corbyn gets them hung up on. These reports are anecdotal, of course. But they chime with the harder data provided by polling.</p> <p>In Brexit Britain, only a Labour government would properly guarantee workers\u2019 rights and minimise any impact on living standards. But with the SNP dominant in Scotland, and the boundary reforms set to benefit the Conservatives, the only route to power is via a competent leader. I voted for Corbyn the first time round, but it has become clear that for the Labour party to survive, he must step down. Don\u2019t take it from me, take if from the heir to Einstein.</p>",

She used to be a glamour model, who met her husband when her agent found her a gig as a \u201cwalk-on girl\u201d at a darts tournament in Nottingham. Yet something moving and profound has developed in a marriage which salvages Wade while often testing his wife in unimaginable ways.

Wade names the two teachers who ridiculed him most and wishes he could seem them now. He only found a belated sense of self-worth when he began working as a mechanic in his dad\u2019s garage, a form of work he still enjoys away from darts.</p> <p>The game often threatens to unhinge him but it has also helped. \u201cDarts is probably the first thing where somebody said: \u2018You\u2019re good at that.\u2019 Wade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/12/phil-taylor-darts-interview\" title=\"\">is third behind Phil Taylor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/15/michael-van-gerwen-phil-taylor-world-darts-championship\" title=\"\">Michael van Gerwen</a> in terms of the most major titles won in the history of the PDC.

Even though I\u2019ve spoken about my condition in interviews he\u2019s never even mentioned it since. He loves me, it\u2019s just that many men aren\u2019t good at talking. I\u2019m pretty good but he\u2019s a closed book. You also understand some of it is probably hereditary.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You get the idiotic minority that go: 'Look at the nutter.' And then the other side who are not sure what to say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When was his second visit to the Priory? \u201cAbout two years later. I had to go because my mind was out of control and going 600mph. I was in mania and needed to be slowed down. Since I\u2019ve spoken about these issues people have said it was brave but talking is the easiest way. You get the idiotic minority that go: \u2018Look at the nutter.\u2019 And then you get the other side who take a step back because they\u2019re not quite sure what to say. If you go in there with an arm in a cast it\u2019s: \u2018Get well soon.\u2019 This is different.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came back from the Priory I went to the UK Open and everyone fell quiet. One player spoke to me and there were a hundred players in there. Colin Lloyd spoke to me first and then Andy Jenkins and, slowly, a few others spoke as well. But there\u2019s no need to be uncertain when speaking to me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a contagious disease from the moon.\u201d</p> <p>Wade prefers to call his condition \u201ca gift. It\u2019s also a hindrance but I think Einstein and Da Vinci had some serious issues. To have the insight and drive to discover or produce something totally new you can\u2019t have a normal thought-process. You need to be different to chase something hard when everyone is laughing at you.\u201d</p> <p>In terms of his own gift, can he shut out people and his problems when playing darts? \u201cIf I\u2019m flying, yeah. It doesn\u2019t happen very much now. That\u2019s partly because of my tablets.\u201d</p> <p>If he didn\u2019t have to take medication would he be a much better player? \u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s no secret I wasn\u2019t taking tablets when I had most of my major success.

          "body": "<p>Africa\u2019s challenge is how to create a strong higher education sector to prepare a new generation of leaders in the professions, business and civil society. This is necessary because the continent has long struggled with how to create and deliver quality tertiary education to its young people. Making progress on this challenge is possible now because Africans are stepping up after decades of academic isolation and inadequate support from their own leaders and from the West.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/02/higher-education-in-africa-science-not-aid\">Higher Education in Africa: Our continent needs science, not aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are fewer than 2,000 colleges and universities on a continent with a billion people in 55 countries. In comparison, the US is home to more than 4000 institutions for 320 million people. Less than 7% percent of Africans have college degrees compared to 30% of North Americans and Europeans. More than half of Africa\u2019s population is under the age of 30. This is either a demographic dividend, if the talent is developed, or a demographic curse if the next generation is large, economically marginal and unable to do the work of advanced economies. Africa is the leading continent in the fraction of its young people sent abroad for education. Sadly, many of the young have remained abroad and represent a \u201cbrain drain\u201d from Africa while providing a talented dose of diversity in America and Europe.<br /></p> <p>Coming on the heels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a> in the US, now is a good time to draw parallels between the education of black people in the US and Africa. And while there are significant challenges and obstacles in terms of educational equity for black people in the US, there is a significant parallel and lesson to be found in comparing colonial Africa and pre-civil rights America. In both cases, there was a de-emphasis on science and math. Black people were given little instruction and were discouraged from these fields. This pattern became embedded and remains that way: black people are scarce in the technology sector. In recent years, rapid growth and higher pay has been in jobs that draw on analytical skills. Knowledge-based jobs have become the key to both national economic growth and personal opportunity. Similarly, in Africa, math was not and is not emphasised, with the result that many of the professional jobs in an emerging continent go to foreign nationals, not African nationals. African schools are not producing the engineers, scientists or architects required to advance its economies in the ways Asian countries did a generation ago. The lesson for Africa is that they must prepare the educated labor force needed for the economic advancement they seek.<br /></p> <p>There are two other issues that challenge the African continent related to tertiary education. Only a handful of the sub-Saharan African schools (outside of South Africa) are ranked in the top 500 in the world. That means African academics are isolated from the global knowledge generation which increasingly comes from collaboration across ranked institutions and national borders. Africans educated in Africa, with some exceptions, are not part of the global talent pool \u2013 employers in Africa complain that they cannot find Africans for professional positions and as a result must bring in outsiders or send the work to the west.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/10/15-steps-closer-to-quality-higher-education-in-africa\">15 steps closer to quality higher education in Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, the research tradition in Africa and especially in science and math is very limited. Whether the issue is research on infectious disease, how to adapt to climate change, ways to increase agricultural productivity, or the best strategy for global leverage of Africa\u2019s rich reserve of commodities, there is a dire need for more African scholars who can conduct research on the issues.<br /></p> <p>As we move to a \u201cflat world\u201d where digital connection removes some barriers to innovation such as distance and physical isolation, Africa is isolated from the most important market \u2013 that of talent and knowledge generation. Those outside with resources can engage Africa but without knowledge and resources, Africa cannot move itself into the global economy. It will be important that Africa owns, develops, manages, and deploys its talent both to advance its own development and to be among the global players in the science and technology domains as diverse as agriculture and medicine on the one hand, and climate change and business management, on the other. When a nation can compete on the production and use of knowledge, there is a better chance for shaping its own fate.<br /></p> <p>That opportunity can become real if two things happen. The first is that Africa\u2019s talent profile is enhanced by preparing more young people and supporting their research and connection to global peers. Happily, African STEM talent is being developed and a strong group of young scientists is on display in a week at the <a href=\"nef.org/gg2016\">Next Einstein Forum</a> in Dakar, Senegal where young African scientists together with colleagues from the West are meeting to develop ways to support science and expand its reach.<br /></p> <p>The second challenge is to build a set of institutions that are first-class, committed to serving as a model for excellence, globally connected, and focused on fields that advance industry and professions. These institutions also need to address African problems and promote economic development. One example of African-based progress is the <a href=\"https://www.aims.ac.za/\">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a> (AIMS) which is a network of graduate programs that offer excellent graduate education with a world-class faculty. AIMS collaborates with leading global institutions and is expanding to connect with research partners and global companies. AIMS has programs in six countries and plans to expand to 15.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/26/africa-produces-just-11-of-global-scientific-knowledge\">Africa produces just 1.1% of global scientific knowledge - but change is coming</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other institutions that have been created first class include Ashesi University in Ghana and the Aga Khan University in East Africa. The Pan African University is just starting with an ambitious plans in several countries. There is also the need to transform and support existing institutions in order to broaden the number of quality institutions.<br /></p> <p>Developing new talent and creating and transforming existing schools is a big lift. To find a model for success one need only look at South Korea. In 1960, Ghana and South Korea were similarly undeveloped and struggling countries. South Korea took the education and industry route to rapid development and is now in the first rank among nations in STEM education. They are industry giants in a diverse sectors. In the US, South Korean companies displaced market leading companies like Motorola (with Samsung), General Electric appliances (with LG) and they have two Korean cars among the top ten ranked cars for 2015.<br /></p> <p>More than ever before we can be cautiously optimistic. Many challenges and obstacles to progress remain. Technology can make rapid progress possible. There are Africans who are stepping forward to lead change. Students are eager to have educational resources in their home countries. Political and economic development are beginning to occur together. Much remains to be done but there is now a sense that its Africa\u2019s time to rise.<br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

Their discovery, if confirmed, is certain to earn a Nobel prize.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/09/gravitational-waves-everything-you-need-to-know\">Gravitational waves: everything you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scientists have hunted for signs of the waves for decades, but until now, their attempts have been frustrated by false signals and instruments that were not sensitive enough to detect the waves by the time they reached Earth.<br /></p> <p> That is expected to change on Thursday, when physicists in the US reveal their latest data from an experiment known as LIGO, or the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The team have detectors in Washington and Louisiana that can spot passing gravitational waves via the minuscule changes in length they produce in two 4km-long pipes.<br /></p> <p>At a press conference in Washington, LIGO scientists are anticipated to reveal a clear, unambiguous gravitational wave signal. It may have come from two vast black holes, one 29 times more massive than the sun, the other 36 times more massive, spiralling around each other and finally crashing together to form a new black hole 62 times the mass of the sun. For all its heft, the new body may be no more than 200 miles wide.<br /></p> <p>The missing mass - equivalent to that of three suns, or six trillion trillion kilotonnes - was converted into energy and released as the gravitational waves LIGO is believed to have detected.<br /></p> <p>\u201cPeople are hugely excited. The rumour is that it\u2019s a whopping big signal, in other words, it\u2019s unambiguous, and that is fantastic,\u201d said Pedro Ferreira, professor of astrophysics at Oxford University, and author of the 2014 book, <a href=\"http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~pgf/Pedro_Ferreira/The_Perfect_Theory.html\">The Perfect Theory: a century of geniuses and the battle over general relativity</a>.<br /></p> <p>When Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915, he changed forever how scientists view the universe. The theory showed that mass makes spacetime curve, an effect that has a multitude of implications. One, that light from distant stars will bend around the sun, was confirmed by Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 1919.<br /></p> <p>The detection of gravitational waves would tick off the last major prediction of general relativity. It would demonstrate that the equations drawn up by Einstein, who refused to believe in black holes himself, hold true in what ranks as the most extreme realm of physics.<br /></p> <p>But there is more to the discovery of gravitational waves than simply proving they exist. If the LIGO signal is as strong as rumours suggest, new instruments could be built to detect gravity waves from colliding black holes and other hugely energetic events all over the universe. </p> <p>\u201cIt would be like having a telescope that, instead of looking at objects in the electromagnetic spectrum, is looking at them with gravitational waves,\u201d said Ferreira. \u201cWe could see things in a completely different way. It would be very blurred vision - gravitational waves are not good at pinpointing objects - but they would help us understand what happens when black holes hs fall into one another.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe fact is whenever we\u2019ve looked at the universe in new ways, with x-rays, with radio waves, we\u2019ve discovered incredible stuff, exotica. So this is going to open up a new window, and for sure we\u2019ll discover bizarre stuff,\u201d he added.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2015/feb/12/the-hunt-for-gravitational-waves-could-be-nearing-success\">The hunt for gravitational waves could be nearing success</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/12/gravitation-waves-signal-rumoured-science\">Rumours</a> that the LIGO team had detected gravitational waves have been circulating in the astrophysics community for months. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/jan/12/gravitational-wave-detection-could-be-a-false-alarm\">many researchers were sceptical</a> and feared the rumours might have been sparked by synthetic signals which are added to the data to test the team\u2019s analytical procedures.<br /></p> <p>\u201cAfter all the rumours over the past few months I certainly expect them to announce a detection at this point,\u201d said Alberto Sesana, a researcher at the University of Birmingham\u2019s Gravitational Wave Group. \u201cWe have to bear in mind that LIGO is one experiment and the only one that can detect such sources. If they claim to have detected gravitational waves, it cannot be confirmed by another instrument, and that is always an issue. But they have been very cautious in doing this properly. I\u2019m confident they have clear and strong evidence for it.\u201d<br /></p> <p>There is a chance a signal will be announced from another source, such as a pair of neutron stars spinning around one another, or a neutron star falling into a black hole. But such cosmic events would be expected to produce weaker signals than the large spike scientists anticipate the LIGO team to reveal.<br /></p> <p>Scientists have declared the discovery of gravitational waves before only to have their hopes dashed. In 2014, researchers on an experiment called Bicep2 claimed to have found evidence for gravitational waves from the big bang, but further analysis by other groups showed that the signals they picked up could be entirely explained by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/22/gravitational-waves-space-dust\">space dust</a> interfering with their measurements.<br /></p> <p>Ulrich Sperhake, a theorist at Cambridge University who studies how gravitational waves are generated by black holes, said the community was very excited and expectant. \u201c I don\u2019t know anyone in the field who expects anything other than a detection to be announced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything but the onset of a new era in observational gravitational astronomy would come as a major surprise on Thursday, but there remains a tiny speculative element to it until we\u2019ll have the official LIGO announcement.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Hendry, a member of the LIGO team at Glasgow University, would not be drawn on the details of Thursday\u2019s announcement. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything more at this stage than wait and see. Or should that be \u201cwatch this spacetime?\u201d he said.</p>",

It should be completely carbon neutral by 2021, thanks to its national grid being sustained by natural resources such as rivers and volcanoes. Vince meets the president and also joins scientists who are helping to preserve the country\u2019s forests. <em tabindex=\"-1\">Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>World\u2019s Most Expensive Cars <br />4.30pm, Channel 4<br /></h2> <p>Debut of a new series in which Ant Anstead follows the specialists of Sotheby\u2019s as they search for collectible vehicles to auction. In this episode, they assess a garageful of glorious antiques in Italy and contemplate a super-rare convertible in Las Vegas: the very first Shelby Cobra, which might be worth as much as $10m. But the price tags are much less interesting than the stories behind the cars: happily, these are well told. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>The Durrells <br />8pm, ITV</h2> <p>This week on the cracking comedy disguised as a gentle period sunshine drama, Larry (Josh O\u2019Connor) is pretentiously outraged when nobody cares about his new novel. Dealing with her son\u2019s dismay \u2013 a nice, sly satire on solipsistic creatives - is one of the spinning plates for chaos-parent Louisa (Keeley Hawes), who also has to deal with children not knowing their times tables and everyone getting smashed on homemade kumquat liqueur. Terrific fun. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Line of Duty <br />9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>As we left Ted Hastings last week, a long shadow had been cast over his probity. So in addition to catching a killer who knows how not to be caught, this finale involves considerably raised stakes in terms of AC-12\u2019s future. What results is another hour of fist-bitingly intense drama and an ending that is simultaneously more conclusive and more ambiguous than you might expect. Think you know where this is going? Prepare to be confounded. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Grantchester <br />9pm, ITV</h2> <p>The extremely watchable 1950s crime drama opens with a village cricket match, where the gentle competition is disturbed by racial tension. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the tragedy that follows when the team are poisoned by the post-match beer and buffet. One resident is killed and it\u2019s up to Sidney and Geordie to find out who\u2019s responsible. Outside work, both chums\u2019 entanglements with married women have the potential to cause scandal. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Genius <br />9pm, National Geographic</h2> <p>Continuing the biopic of one of history\u2019s deepest thinkers. Geoffrey Rush\u2019s tongue-out era Einstein is still some way off, so Johnny Flynn continues to portray young Albert in the vein of a steam-age Mr Robot. At Zurich Polytechnic, Einstein\u2019s infatuation with Mileva Mari\u0107 grows, despite the presence of a fiancee back home. With their affair threatening to extinguish the Bunsen on their academic studies, Professor Weber threatens to intervene. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>100 Days of Trump <br />10pm, Viceland</h2> <p>The Vice squad attempt to find 100 stories from the first 100 days of the Mandarin Candidate\u2019s reign \u2013 bans, regressive legislation, flip-flops \u2013 to illustrate his unique qualities and approach. This shouldn\u2019t be difficult, given that the administration resembles a life-size representation of Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s The Last Judgment, with designated zones of horror and damnation. If we\u2019re lucky, there may even be another 100 days. <em>Ali Catterall</em><br /></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service, (Peter Hunt, 1969), 4pm, ITV<br /></strong>Sean Connery is replaced by the one it\u2019s always hard to remember, George Lazenby, in a Bond movie that has deservedly grown in estimation over the years. Blofeld is again the villain, now played by Telly Savalas, and director Hunt handles the snowy Alpine action well. The dark tone of Ian Fleming\u2019s novel, heaping pain on his hero, survives as 007 meets his match in Tracy (Diana Rigg) and proposes marriage, a very risky undertaking. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong><br />As Good As It Gets, (James L Brooks, 1997), 9pm, Sony Movie Channel</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c4f728e2318b43087c788787ece083a565056ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c4f728e2318b43087c788787ece083a565056ee/0_0_2433_1461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/COLUMBIA TRISTAR/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for this, though their relationship in Brooks\u2019s expensive-looking romcom is barely credible. He\u2019s a fastidious, phobically challenged, irascible old writer; she\u2019s a waitress at the one restaurant in town that still serves him, and there\u2019s a sickly subplot concerning her ailing son. But it\u2019s all done with consummate skill. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><br /><strong>Drive, (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2011), 11pm, BBC2</strong><br />One of Ryan Gosling\u2019s star-making roles: in Refn\u2019s cool and highly stylised thriller, he plays a nameless getaway driver whose angelic features mask a capacity for extreme violence.

The chance discovery, initially made by a scientist and amateur beekeeper whose plastic bag had been eaten through by the moth caterpillars, was reported this week by researchers at Cambridge University and the Spanish National Research Council.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/24/plastic-munching-worms-could-help-wage-war-on-waste-galleria-mellonella\">Plastic-eating worms could help wage war on waste</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How thoughtful of nature to provide bugs that eat our rubbish. Is this the end of landfill, turtles with plastic-congested stomachs, and trees adorned with tattered ribbons of shopping bags?</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s never that simple, is it? Attempts to commandeer nature to do our dirty work never seem to turn out as hoped, whether these take the form of planting trees to soak up carbon dioxide, or introducing invasive species for pest control, or using microorganisms to clean up oil spills. Remember the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/30/cane-toads-on-the-march-invasive-species-finds-ideal-niche-in-australia\" title=\"\">Australian cane toad debacle</a>? The toads were introduced in the 1930s to control crop pests but instead gorged themselves on other local wildlife and spread across the country.</p> <p>These creatures, the larvae of the greater wax moth (<em>Galleria mellonella</em>), can devour polyethylene, which along with the closely related polypropylene is the main type of plastic found in waste. But you\u2019d need an awful lot of them to make a significant dent on the plastic waste problem. The UK alone discards almost 2m tonnes of this stuff every year. At the rate of consumption reported by the researchers \u2013 one worm gets through about two milligrams of plastic a day \u2013 you\u2019d need billions of caterpillars eating constantly all year round to deal with that.</p> <p>Quite aside from how and where you\u2019d farm all these bugs, there\u2019s something about them that news reports have failed to mention. Wax moths, which are found throughout the world, are so-called because they eat wax. Specifically, they love to eat the wax from which bees make their honeycombs \u2013 and so <a href=\"https://www.beeworks.com/wax-moth/\" title=\"\">they can devastate\u00a0bee colonies</a>. The two common species of wax moth, of which\u00a0<em>Galleria mellonella</em> is one, are thought to cause more than \u00a34m worth of damage annually in the United States\u00a0alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"664b602e4c25976655fdd916dbea062d071945f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/664b602e4c25976655fdd916dbea062d071945f2/0_100_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bees in a hive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018With bee populations already under severe stress, we might want to think twice about breeding one of their common airborne enemies in huge numbers.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Komka/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/decline-of-bees-poses-potential-risks-to-major-crops-says-un\" title=\"\">bee populations already under severe stress</a> from pesticides, habitat loss and predators, we might want to think twice about breeding one of their common airborne enemies in huge numbers \u2013 even if the intention was to somehow keep them in plastics-processing centres. The idea that if bees disappear then humankind will follow four years later, popularly misattributed to Albert Einstein, might be a touch hyperbolic. But without their pollinating assistance, crop cultivation would be in deep trouble.</p> <p>Polyethylene sits around in the environment because its molecules are so hard to break down. Ordinary soil microorganisms don\u2019t have the resources for it. These plastics are built up from the hydrocarbon molecules in oil, and ideally we\u2019d turn them back into oil after we had used them, regenerating a valuable substance rather than sacrificing it as waste. Chemists have been working long and hard to do that, using special catalysts to induce the chemical reactions. But it\u2019s tough, and only very recently have they started to see progress. It\u2019s precisely because wax is chemically similar to polyethylene that the wax moth caterpillars can biodegrade it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/17/tiny-plastic-pellets-found-on-73-of-uk-beaches\">Tiny plastic pellets found on 73% of UK beaches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A far easier and less hazardous solution to the plastic problem could be found in bacteria, however. After all, it seems you can find bacteria that will eat almost anything. Some happily devour toxic chemicals, such as perchlorate (weed killer); others thrive amid radioactive waste. And indeed last year <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2080279-bacteria-found-to-eat-pet-plastics-could-help-do-the-recycling/\" title=\"\">a team of Japanese scientists</a> identified a bacterium existing in the\u00a0wild that can feed on another common plastic, polyethylene terephthalate, which is used to make bottles for soft drinks and\u00a0water.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that bacteria might, in fact, be responsible for the plastic-digesting ability of <em>Galleria mellonella</em> larvae. Another wax-eater, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mealmoth\" title=\"\">Indian mealmoth</a>, was found in 2014 to house\u00a0bacteria in its digestive tract that\u00a0can break down polyethylene. <em>Galleria</em> might prove to have such gut bacteria too.</p> <p>Those bacteria could provide the ideal solution. They could be brewed up in fermentation vats that would dissolve plastics without anyone having to contemplate breeding vast wax moth colonies. Alternatively, it might be possible to extract the particular enzymes the caterpillars use and put them to work on their own \u2013 a kind of concentrate of gastric juices.</p> <p>These are the real reasons why the new discovery is promising, and not because we\u2019ll soon be feeding plastic bags to caterpillars. As usual with science, you don\u2019t get the solution on a plate, but have to follow clues with patience and care. It doesn\u2019t make for great headlines. But honestly, the bees would thank you for it.</p>",

          "body": "<p>By the end of the 19th century, many physicists believed there really wasn\u2019t any more to learn about the workings of nature and the properties of matter and radiation. On balance, it might have been easier for everyone if things had stayed that way. Then we could just study Newton and Maxwell and all go home, too. Here\u2019s a picture of an apple landing on Newton\u2019s head.</p> <p>Things changed in 1900 when Max Planck proposed that the energy of electromagnetic radiation was proportional to its frequency. This is known as Planck\u2019s constant which is a tiny number. Even smaller than one. This led Planck to conclude that the radiation had to be lumpy.</p> <p>Everyone ignored Planck \u2013 presumably because they couldn\u2019t understand him \u2013 until Einstein realised that, in a photoelectric effect, high intensity light did not result in electrons being knocked free with more energy, just <em tabindex=\"-1\">more </em>electrons being knocked free. Wow! In 1909, Rutherford discovered that when alpha particles were fired at a thin gold foil, most of them passed through harmlessly. Only <em tabindex=\"-1\">a few</em> bounced back! This led him to conclude that ...</p> <p>Look, I\u2019m sorry, this is pointless. You\u2019re not really following a word of this, are you? Nor has the illustrator, who has just resorted to doodling people skiing and some pints of lager. I did try warning Ladybird that quantum mechanics is far too tricky to explain in 25 pages but they were insistent. And the money was quite good. That\u2019s the Al-Khalili constant.</p> <p>Let\u2019s try making things a bit simpler. Here are some quantum rules. Electrons can only fall to a lower orbit if there is enough space. Therefore, one electron has to wait till a photon has allowed another electron to jump to a higher orbit before it can go a bit lower. There is a long queue to switch orbits and electrons have been known to barge their way to the front rather than wait their turn. Naughty electrons! Actually scrub all that because, in 1921, Niels Bohr discovered that atoms weren\u2019t like miniature solar systems and were more like clouds of fuzzy electron-ness.</p> <p>I\u2019m touched you\u2019re still with me. Really, I am. Most people would have given up. I\u2019ll try to speed up. Here\u2019s a drawing of Schr\u00f6dinger without his cat thinking uncertainly about wave function \u2013 which Heisenberg turned into his Uncertainty Principle. This can be quite easily explained. Imagine a sentence that you can just about understand on its own. Now imagine another sentence following it that you can just about understand on its own. The uncertainty principle predicts that when you try to read a third sentence, you will almost certainly be uncertain about how it related to the previous two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"577d9519026694945c743e60759ac88972d826ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577d9519026694945c743e60759ac88972d826ce/0_0_672_1000/672.jpg\" alt=\"Quantum Mechanics: A Ladybird Expert Book by Jim Al-Khalili (Michael Joseph, \u00a37.99)\" width=\"672\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quantum Mechanics: A Ladybird Expert Book by Jim Al-Khalili (Michael Joseph, \u00a37.99)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I now want to talk about tunnelling. A quantum particle can travel in all sorts of directions. For instance, it can either go over a hill or through it. Sometimes it can do both things at the same time. That\u2019s how the sun shines. Also, for every piece of matter, there is anti-matter and if they collide all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>We now come to a picture of Schr\u00f6dinger <em>with</em> his cat. Poor old Snowy was shut in a state of quantum superposition inside a box with some radioactive material and managed to be both dead and alive at the same time. The only way of knowing which was the real state was by opening the box \u2013 which Schr\u00f6dinger didn\u2019t want to do because he would have been gutted if Snowy had died. As far as anyone knows, Snowy is still dead and alive inside his box.</p> <p>In the mid-1930s, quantum mechanics became even more quantum with the discovery of quarks, leptons and gauge bosons. Here\u2019s a drawing of a spade going into the ground because the illustrator was having a nervous breakdown. Here\u2019s something a bit spooky. Two separated particles can be connected, in that something that happens to one can simultaneously affect the other, even if it has to travel faster than the speed of light which isn\u2019t really possible. One way of trying to think about this is through quantum electrodynamics, which states that empty space is never really empty. Rather, it\u2019s like an empty car park that is full of cars.</p> <p>I could be writing any old nonsense by now and you wouldn\u2019t be any the wiser. My editor certainly wasn\u2019t and seemed to be under the impression this was another in the Ladybird parody series. So what does it all mean? Search me. One of the guiding precepts is that we can never know what is going in the quantum world when we are not looking. Or, as I\u2019ve just proved, when we are.</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> W = TF<sup>2</sup>.<br /></p>",

His organisation is currently supporting 140 academics from the wider Middle East.</p> <p>Those taken in by colleges will have their university fees, accommodation, food and professional costs met, and are invited to stay for a maximum of two years.</p> <p>At Christ Church, the dean, the Very Rev Professor Martyn Percy, said a Syrian professor of pharmaceutical chemistry, Hadia AlMahli, started her time with them this month and they could be open to others joining her.</p> <p>\u201cWe took a decision several months ago that we would try to offer hospitality to academics at risk in the Middle East,\u201d said Percy, whose college is one of the largest and wealthiest in Oxford.</p> <p>\u201cHadia was in Aleppo working at the university when she was forced to leave because of missiles and rockets raining down on the city.\u201d</p> <p>When Einstein moved to Princeton from Oxford in 1933, he asked that the \u00a3400 stipend he received from the college be used to save fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9s.</p> <p>It is unlikely that Oxford\u2019s colleges will take in more than a dozen academics from Syria, given their financial pressures.

For a classical weepy nothing does it for me quite like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQuahSdTvU4\">Kathleen Ferrier singing Gluck\u2019s What is Life?</a></p> <p>One song that reduces me to a quivering wreck is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAu3a7CMA84\">Somewhere</a> from West Side Story, but it has to be this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAu3a7CMA84\">Barbra Streisand version</a>, and if we\u2019re going right to the heart of it, three minutes 15 seconds in, when Babs just soars. Trust me you will feel on top of the world after you\u2019ve cried yourself a river for Tony and Maria.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAu3a7CMA84\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cAu3a7CMA84?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Blowin\u2019 in the Wind is a wonderful song, but Bob Dylan\u2019s original doesn\u2019t do anything for me emotionally. However, give it to Little Stevie Wonder and Clarence Paul and I cry like a baby. Why? Maybe because there\u2019s something unbearably poignant about him singing \u201cHow many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man\u201d when he is still a boy. (Clarence Paul is just in the background on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzQNxFvfJ6M\">this version</a>)</p> <p>Aretha Franklin\u2019s A Natural Woman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsnZT7Z2yQ\">performed at the Kennedy Center in 2015</a> in front of the Obamas at a tribute to Carole King has given me many a good weep. It\u2019s not simply the brilliance of Aretha\u2019s singing or Carole\u2019s song. It\u2019s certainly not the song\u2019s innate sadness \u2013 this is one of the great songs about the transcendent power of love. It\u2019s the triple emotional whammy in the video \u2013 Aretha sitting at the piano to perform then standing up, mic in hand, and throwing her fur coat to the floor, King watching with joyous disbelief, and Michelle and Barack weeping along, proving even politicians can be properly human.</p> <p>My passion for crying goes back to when I was ill as a young boy and was bed-bound for a long time. I had all this horribly constipated emotion and anger lodged deep within me. After a while I realised I had to cry at least once a day, and if I didn\u2019t the buildup was such that it became physically painful. Eventually I began to think crying was like an orgasm \u2013 liberating, joyous and a relief. And if those tears didn\u2019t come, boy you were left frustrated.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsnZT7Z2yQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHsnZT7Z2yQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Over the past year, as the world has gone tits up, I\u2019ve become desperate in my search for music to make me cry. I suppose it\u2019s like any addiction \u2013 the more you indulge, the more you need. Sometimes I search the internet hoping to find songs I\u2019ve never heard of that will give me a bigger, better weep than anything before. This is how I came across Jeff Buckley\u2019s gorgeous version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUq9sgPqfJ8&amp;spfreload=10\">We All Fall in Love Sometimes</a>. I defy you not to cry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/26/george-michael-press-encounters-publicist-tabloids\">Encounters with George Michael \u2013 'His publicist thought I was tabloid scum'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, there have been two songs I\u2019ve returned to time and again for a satisfying sob. Strangely, they are not sad songs, but idealistic ones, and both are performed by Pete Seeger. This Land is Your Land, sung by Seeger with Bruce Springsteen at the Obama inauguration, breaks my heart. There is no more moving reminder of what is possible.</p> <p>But my ultimate weepy is We Shall Overcome. I adore the scratchy black-and-white recording of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEZkZamGCmE\">We Shall Overcome</a> Seeger performed with members of the civil rights movement in 1963. The only<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCbACC-lskU\"> version</a> that makes me blub more is this one sung last year by a group of asylum-seeker friends. Watch, weep, and agitate.</p>",

Even now, more than a decade after moving to the UK, it\u2019s clear that she still feels uncomfortable talking about the situation that led to her fleeing Russia. She says, hastily, that she was forced to leave due to her involvement in a political movement. \u201cThere were threats to myself and my family and it became impossible to work and have a normal life. I was in a dangerous position.\u201d</p> <p>The Russian-language teacher left for London with her children before settling in the North. Visiting her children\u2019s primary school every day, Petrov soon felt a strong urge to teach in her new country. \u201cI realised that there were many similarities [between schools in Russia and in the UK] \u2013 there\u2019s the same atmosphere in school, teachers are the same \u2013 and I thought that I could easily do this job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/07/war-and-violence-drive-majority-of-people-fleeing-to-europe-by-sea-not-economics\">War and violence drive 80% of people fleeing to Europe by sea, not economics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, she faced a couple of difficulties \u2013 namely improving her English and a lack of demand for Russian teachers. Ruling out the classroom, she earned a living as a private Russian tutor and interpreter for four years, but her desire to teach in a school only grew. Around this time, Petrov discovered <a href=\"http://www.reconnectonline.org.uk/\">Reconnect</a>, a charity set up to help refugees to fulfil their ambitions of teaching in the UK. </p> <p>Reconnect advised and supported her to organise documents from the National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC) confirming her overseas qualification, and she studied to improve her English before applying for a teacher training diploma. She worked at a primary school, then got a job as a part-time Russian teacher at a secondary school. \u201cI just knew I wanted to teach Russian,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to find out about the training.\u201d </p> <h2>Disappearing funding</h2> <p>Petrov is one of an <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/What-we-do/Refugee-support/Refugee-facts-and-figures\">estimated 118,995 refugees</a> living in the UK. Many of those are highly skilled but unable to easily find work. Those with a teaching background come up against a number of challenges in rejoining the profession in their new country. \u201cMany refugees are not familiar with and are in need of information and an understanding of the UK education system, learning practices, curriculum, policies, entry requirements and progression routes,\u201d explains Theodros Abraham, an associate lecturer in development studies at Birkbeck, University of London, and founder of Reconnect. \u201cThe available services are few, fragmented, unfocused and short-term.\u201d Reconnect has so far helped 54 refugees from 20 countries gain Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) since it was started in 2003. </p> <p>Over the years, funding to help refugees enter the profession has evaporated. The Refugee Council\u2019s Refugees Into Teaching programme, which supported people looking to requalify and take on paid teaching positions through mentoring and placements, closed in 2011 after three years due to cuts. The organisation now offers informal advice. </p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to refugees rebuilding teaching careers, complex and confusing requalifying pathways make this very difficult,\u201d says Andrew Lawton, integration and employment services manager at the Refugee Council. \u201cSpecialist guidance is needed if we are able to support refugees back into the classroom and back into the jobs they love.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Specialist guidance is needed to support refugees back into the classroom and back into the jobs they love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Syrian Yasser al-Jassem, 36, has found it difficult to find paid teaching work. Since moving to Manchester two years ago, the former Arabic teacher has volunteered at schools and taken courses such as safeguarding child protection through <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.empowering-learning.com/\">Empowering Learning,</a> a training programme designed to help place overseas teachers in the UK.</p> <p> \u201cIdeally I need to do my QTS but it takes years,\u201d he says.\u201cI don\u2019t know if maybe it\u2019s easier to do maths, English and science GCSE then I can apply for a teaching assistant job.\u201d He\u2019s currently working as a private Arabic tutor. He says that he still needs to improve his English before teaching in a school, but is frustrated by the lack of assistance from the authorities. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d he says. \u201cThe job centre pushed me to find any job, and although I\u2019m a teacher they don\u2019t care. I want to teach \u2013 for me, it\u2019s not just a job.\u201d</p> <p>Abraham advises would-be teachers to obtain official assessment and confirmation of their overseas qualifications from NARIC, then apply for places on appropriate teacher-training programmes.</p> <p>Lawton adds that it is possible that a qualified teacher from outside EU can teach within a school without a UK-issued QTS, but generally it is easier to get the QTS first. He notes, though, that while undertaking a part-time teacher training programme provides the most viable opportunity for many refugees, it can be very costly given their circumstances.</p> <h2>Jumping the hurdles</h2> <p> When refugees are able to get past the hurdles and become teachers, their background means they have the ability to inject a wealth of skills, knowledge and experience to schools. \u201cThe most distinctive capacities refugees and asylum seekers can bring to classrooms are the fact that they have overcome, and are still overcoming, enormous challenges, to have got to being a teacher,\u201d says Jay Derrick, director of teacher education at University College London, Institute of Education. The college ran a special route to a standard post-compulsory PGCE for refugees and asylum seekers from 2007 to 2013 until government funding was withdrawn.</p> <p>The fact that they have lived in very different situations socially, culturally, linguistically and politically means that they contribute to the diversity of classrooms, he says. Some refugee teachers talk about their backgrounds with their class. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/nov/22/five-ways-to-help-migrant-children-settle-in-your-class\">Five ways to help migrant children settle in your class</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the case for Ines Salom Lynch, a 31-year-old primary school teacher at a school in Barnet, London. Salom Lynch arrived in the UK when she was just six years old after her family left war-torn Bosnia. She often speaks to children at the school about her background and in June organised assemblies raising awareness of refugees \u2013 giving a nod to famous refugees such as Albert Einstein \u2013 as part of Refugee Week.</p> <p>As Derrick notes, \u201cThere are increasing numbers of students in UK classes who also come from families affected by migration and who may also be refugees.

Prime ministers, pissants that they are, getting away with this stuff, having power, appointing people, running the country. Imagine the cheek.</p> <p>Champagne radio. Why bother with facts when you can do rolling rage?</p> <p>This week there was some quiet but illuminating discussion in political circles about <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/political-life/\">an essay I\u2019ve written for the latest edition of Meanjin</a> about the toxic culture of Australian politics.</p> <p>The life I describe in the essay is borderline unbearable. A lot of the current inhabitants of #auspol privately agree.</p> <p>Part of the reason political life is borderline unbearable is because the line between reason and unreason in public discourse sometimes feels gossamer thin. We are saturated with ranting which generates heat, but no light. This hot house ranting is taking place inside bespoke bubbles.</p> <p>Inside our various, populist, or ideologically driven, or vengeful gated communities, tribal wars are raging in this country, and there is a competition to see who can be the most outrageous.</p> <p>The public at large is switching off, fancying they won\u2019t be any the worse for it. The sad truth is they are right.</p> <p>So what can we do?</p> <p>Well, for a start, Alan can be left to his own devices. Prime ministers, premiers and ministers don\u2019t need to consent to be raw meat thrown to a lion. They can respect their office, even if Jones doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>The time they spend trying to placate Alan on the radio could be put to better use, liking looking after the interests of the people who vote them into office, and being seen to look after those interests.</p> <p>If Alan is troublesome because <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/comment/alan-jones-paul-murray-ray-hadley-friends-the-coalition-could-do-without-20170707-gx743f.html\">he\u2019s got a direct line to the Coalition base</a>, then centre right politicians need to examine how they create their own direct line to the base. These things are not impossible, particularly not in this day and age. They just take work.</p> <p>As to the broader problem of politics as endless seminar, that\u2019s a tougher nut to crack.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/14/it-just-frustrates-me-barnaby-joyce-hits-out-at-liberal-party-infighting\">had some choice words for his Liberal colleagues</a> this week that they\u2019d do well to reflect on.</p> <p>I\u2019ve known Joyce for a very long time, and I\u2019ve never seen him so frustrated.</p> <p>He told me the feedback he was getting out in the regions is visceral. \u201cThey look at political candidates and say \u2018Have you ever actually lived, mate? Do you know what it\u2019s like to not have any money in your wallet? Do you know what it\u2019s like to think, shit, I want a life with dignity and I\u2019m on the pension, and I can\u2019t actually afford food, so how do I do this and keep my dignity in this town?\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s one hell of a gap for politics to bridge, and there\u2019s really only one antidote.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be drawn into the stupid, noxious bubbles. They waste your time and erode your agency. Remain calm. Focus on the problems that need solving.</p> <p>Stow the endless seminar, the self justification, and apologia \u2013 and get to work.</p>",

The post-cold war escalation of Nato activities and the encirclement of Russia threatens, once again, to take us back to those precarious times (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/uk-to-deploy-hundreds-of-troops-and-aircraft-to-eastern-europe\" title=\"\">800 UK troops join Nato force</a>, 27 October). One doesn\u2019t have to be an apologist for Putin to recognise that Russia is being demonised and the recent reinforcement of Nato troops in Estonia and Romania will only increase Russia\u2019s fear of western intentions and ratchet up the danger of conflict.</p> <p>The idea that Putin\u2019s Russia poses a threat to western Europe is a myth concocted by the US and the military-industrial complex in order to assert its worldwide hegemony. Russia\u2019s effective intervention in Syria to prop up Assad and to prevent the forces of Islamic fundamentalism taking over does not fit the script written by the US and its allies, so there is a renewed determination to punish them \u2013 an extremely dangerous tactic that could backfire catastrophically. We need to demand that our government plays no role in this unnecessary escalation.<br /><strong>John Green</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 You report that \u201ctensions between Nato members and Russia have been heightened since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014 and Ukraine descended into civil war as a result\u201d. I would like to stress the importance of using correct wording when describing the situation in eastern Ukraine so that readers are not misled about the real essence of the conflict.</p> <p>The international community, including organisations such as the UN, EU, OSCE and the Council of Europe have clearly recognised that there is nothing but Russian aggression against Ukraine which has led to the illegal annexation of Crimea and the military aggression in the east of Ukraine. In total, Russia has occupied 47,000 sq km of Ukrainian territories which is more than the territory of a number of European states.<br /><strong>Natalia Galibarenko</strong><br /><em>Ambassador of Ukraine to the UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/cold-war-20-how-russia-and-the-west-reheated-a-historic-struggle\" title=\"\">Cold war 2.0</a>\u201d (25 October) suggested that \u201cextended sanctions could weaken Putin\u2019s grip on power\u201d. My impression was that this had been western policy towards Russia for more than 10 years now, during which time President Putin\u2019s popularity within the country has never fallen below 60% and at present \u201clanguishes\u201d at 82%.

          "body": "<p>Where did the US get the uranium it needed to build the atom bombs it dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? From a mine somewhere in the US? In Canada? My guess is that not many people know, or have even asked. The answer lies deep in the heart of Africa. It was extracted from the Shinkolobwe mine in then Belgian Congo, owned by Union Mini\u00e8re, part of the mother country\u2019s biggest and wealthiest company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique. Without access to that mine, the atom bomb might never have been built by American scientists during the second world war.</p> <p>Susan Williams\u2019s last book, <em>Who Killed Hammarskj\u00f6ld?</em>, prompted the UN to set up a new inquiry into<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/14/un-inquiry-1961-dag-hammarskjold-air-crash\"> the death \u2013 in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia \u2013 of its former secretary general</a>. Her new, meticulously researched book has shades of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\">Graham Greene</a>, a hint of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/josephconrad\">Conrad</a>, even echoes of <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p> <p>Using newly opened archives and personal interviews, she describes how the American <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/intelligence-history/oss/art03.htm\">Office of Strategic Services</a> (OSS) \u2013 forerunner of the CIA \u2013 recruited a motley band to ensure the uranium reached the US and did not fall into the hands of Nazi Germany. The group of hand-picked officers included two ornithologists \u2013 good training, perhaps, for a spy. They posed as rubber prospectors or investigators of diamond smugglers. The word \u201curanium\u201d never passed their lips: instead, even in coded telegrams, they referred to \u201craw material\u201d, \u201cdiamonds\u201d, or, simply, \u201cgems\u201d.They were not told why the US was so desperate to secure a regular supply of the high-grade uranium ore. Not even Wilbur Owings Hogue, the OSS station chief in Belgian Congo, described by Williams as \u201ca very clever civil engineer with a self-deprecating sense of humour\u201d, was told.</p> <p>Their task was made more difficult and dangerous by pro-German sentiments among some of the Belgian industrialists and colonists in the Congo. Union Mini\u00e8re had already sold significant amounts of uranium ore to Germany. (Williams points to what was happening in Belgium itself, where businesses were dealing with their German occupiers: in 1943 alone, Belgian firms delivered 155 locomotives to Germany.) However, the US had a key ally in <a href=\"http://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/edgar-sengier\">Edgar Sengier</a>, head of Union Mini\u00e8re\u2019s New York-based operations, who after the war was awarded the medal for merit, which was then the US government\u2019s highest civilian award.</p> <p>In Congo, many businessmen were waiting to see who looked like winning the war before committing themselves to the Allies. Senior Belgian officials were themselves involved in diamond smuggling, sometimes in Red Cross parcels, for their personal benefit. There were always doubts about their loyalties; few could be trusted. Using diamond smuggling as cover for their true role remained a potentially fatal strategy for OSS officers. Hogue\u2019s life was threatened more than once, as a result of leaks from a Belgian journalist he recruited as an informer.</p> <p>Williams contrasts the luxurious living of Congo\u2019s white inhabitants with the brutal treatment of the black population. She describes how, on his first day there, a US code officer was faced with the sight of a Congolese man in ragged shorts, kneeling on the ground, with a Belgian official standing over him with a <em>chicotte</em> \u2013 a whip made of leather thongs with a metal end. \u201cEvery lash was followed by a scream of agony,\u201d the US officer recorded. \u201cWhen the prescribed number of lashes had been delivered, the black\u2019s skin from neck to waist was a mass of blood with ribs shining through.\u201d The officer was told it was punishment for stealing a packet of cigarettes from a Belgian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The moral authority of the struggle against fascism was not applied to the inequalities and injustice in the Congo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soon after the end of the war, in November 1945, strikers protesting at terrible living and working conditions in L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa, capital of Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the port of Matadi (through which much of the uranium was shipped) were killed along with women and children. \u201cThe moral authority of the struggle against fascism was not applied to the inequalities and injustice in the Congo,\u201d Williams writes. Workers at the Shinkolobwe mine were not protected at all from radiation.</p> <p>If I have a quibble about <em>Spies in the Congo</em> it is that, on occasion, dense \u2013 albeit rich \u2013 detail slows down the pace of what is truly a thriller, in which Williams paints clear and sympathetic pictures of characters thrust into a totally unfamiliar territory.</p> <p>She opens her book with a letter Albert Einstein wrote to President Roosevelt on 2 August 1939, alerting him to the possibility of constructing a powerful bomb turning uranium into a new and important source of energy. \u201cThe most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo,\u201d Einstein wrote.</p> <p>There is another terrible legacy, aside from the bombs dropped on Japan, at the source of that uranium. Radioactive waste at Shinkolobwe has led to birth defects and cancers. After the collapse of a mineshaft, the UN asked the International Atomic Energy Agency to <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=412&amp;ArticleID=4661&amp;l=en\">investigate conditions there</a>. Its study found that 6,000 small-scale miners had been digging for coltan and cobalt: everyone working there was at risk of developing health problems because of high levels of radiation.</p> <p>\u201cShinkolobwe has never been commemorated,\u201d the Congolese journalist Oliver Tshinyoka noted last year \u2013 the 70th anniversary of the atom bomb attacks on Japan.

What could be quicker than instant?\u201d Blocked! <br /></p> <p>But: \u201cGreat Postcards from the Edge quote there\u201d = date request! <br /></p> <p>Alas, that led to little success so I\u2019m again taking Fisher\u2019s advice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/jan/09/golden-globes-2017-quotes-of-the-night\">as echoed by Meryl Streep</a> this month: \u201cTake your broken heart, make it into art.\u201d The art I\u2019ve decided to make is to discover the world\u2019s best one-liner. This one\u2019s for you, Carrie:</p> <p>Some one-liners are so great, they\u2019ve become their own cliches. Some characters deserve their own category for speaking almost exclusively in them - take a bow, Oscar Wilde, Dorothy Parker, Groucho Marx, Mae West, Mark Twain, Maya Angelou.</p> <p>What makes a great one-liner? Certainly not an inspirational quote in an infuriatingly pretty font over an evocative filtered landscape. They are more likely to be bawdy, rambunctious and not always kind. The edge makes them memorable, although that\u2019s not to say they can\u2019t be profound. </p> <p>Straight-up humour isn\u2019t enough: the funniest one-liners have a sardonic, sarcastic or even bitchy undertone. The dreamier ones need a tinge of sadness or bitterness. Those offering guidance need to insinuate it\u2019s advice the author of the phrase wistfully - or bitterly - wishes they\u2019d taken themselves. Concision is essential. <br /></p> <p>Some wordplay will make the \u2018inspirational\u2019 one liner forgivable for its linguistic merit. Don\u2019t state the bleeding obvious: tell us something counterintuitive, or something that reveals the grit of your struggle and how you\u2019ve mastered words as your response.</p> <p>Retorts are out; if you need someone to rack up a line for you to knock down, then strictly speaking that isn\u2019t a one-liner. It should include all its wit, grit and tips in that standalone line. Metaphors, self-deprecation and genuine poignancy are in.</p> <p>With those criteria in mind, here\u2019s my - unapologetically subjective - stab at the shortlist of the world\u2019s greatest one-liners of all time:</p> <p><strong>Self-deprecating</strong><br />\u201cIt costs a lot of money to look this cheap\u201d - Dolly Parton<br />\u201cI used to be Snow White, but I drifted\u201d - Mae West<br />\u201cMy face looks like a wedding cake left out in the rain\u201d - WH Auden</p> <p><strong>Wordplay</strong><br />\u201cI can resist everything, except temptation\u201d - Oscar Wilde<br />\u201cBetter to be looked over than overlooked\u201d - Mae West<br />\u201cThere are two kinds of people in the world: Those who believe there are two kinds of people in the world and those who don\u2019t\u201d - Robert Benchley</p> <p><strong>Perceptive</strong><br />\u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it to a six-year-old, you don\u2019t understand it yourself\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein<br />\u201cFaith: not wanting to know what is true\u201d - Friedrich Nietzsche<br />\u201cAnything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung\u201d - Voltaire<br />\u201cCopy from one, it\u2019s plagiarism; copy from two, it\u2019s research\u201d - Wilson Mizner<br />\u201cMoral indignation is jealousy with a halo\u201d - HG Wells</p> <p><strong>Sardonic</strong><br />\u201cI\u2019ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\u2019t it\u201d - Groucho Marx<br />\u201cEvery love\u2019s the love before in a duller dress\u201d - Dorothy Parker<br />\u201cWar is God\u2019s way of teaching Americans geography\u201d - Ambrose Bierce<br />\u201cIf you haven\u2019t got anything nice to say about anybody, come sit next to me\u201d - Alice Roosevelt Longworth (and Olympia Dukakis in Steel Magnolias, of course)</p> <p><strong>Underrated</strong><br />\u201cHappiness makes up in height what it lacks in length\u201d - Robert Frost<br />\u201cIf you think education is expensive, try ignorance\u201d - Derek Bok</p> <p><strong>Just brilliant</strong><br />\u201cYou can lead a horticulture, but you can\u2019t make her think\u201d - Dorothy Parker<br />\u201cThere is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\u201d - Oscar Wilde </p> <p><strong>Advice</strong><br />\u201cWhen someone shows you who they are believe them; the first time\u201d - Maya Angelou<br />\u201cWhen you\u2019re going through hell, keep going\u201d - Winston Churchill<br />\u201cBefore you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off\u201d - Coco Chanel<br /></p> <p><strong>Poignant</strong><br />\u201cSometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple\u201d - Dr Seuss<br />\u201cAt 18 our convictions are hills from which we look; at 45 they are caves in which we hide\u201d - F Scott Fitzgerald</p> <p><strong>Inspirational</strong><br />\u201cWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars\u201d - Oscar Wilde<br />\u201cIt is never too late to be what you might have been\u201d - George Eliot<br />\u201cNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent\u201d \u2013 Eleanor Roosevelt<br />\u201cIf everything is under control, you are going too slow\u201d - Mario Andretti</p> <p><strong>I can relate</strong><br />\u201cBeing a writer is like having homework every night for the rest of your life\u201d - Lawrence Kasdan</p> <p><strong>I\u2019d best wrap this up because:</strong><br />\u201cHe that uses many words for explaining any subject, doth, like the cuttlefish, hide himself for the most part in his own ink\u201d - John Ray</p> <p><strong>And finally, take all these with a pinch of salt because:</strong><br />\u201cThe aphorism is a personal observation inflated into a universal truth, a private posing as a general\u201d - Stefan Kanfer</p> <p>What do you think is the world\u2019s best one-liner?</p> <p><em>Gary Nunn is a regular contributor to Mind your language.

These are the same fossil fuels \u2013 coal, oil and gas \u2013 that are the major drivers of global warming, leading to shocking increases in extreme weather, including <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/angry-summer-report\">heatwaves</a>. </p> <p>Although cricket is a summer sport, extreme heat is no joke for cricketers, as anyone who has played the game in such conditions can confirm. </p> <p>There are well-known examples of the effect of extreme heat on cricketers. After compiling an extraordinarily brave double century against India in the tied Test at Chennai in 1985, Australian batsman Dean Jones <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/605597.html\">described</a> what it was like to bat in infernal conditions: \u201cWhen you\u2019re urinating in your pants and vomiting 15 times, you\u2019ve got massive problems.\u201d </p> <p>When finally dismissed for 210, Jones was taken to hospital on a saline drip.</p> <p>Physical activity in extreme heat can lead to severe health problems, including fatalities. According to the <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/silentkillerreport\">Climate Council</a>, heatwaves have killed more Australians than any other natural hazards and have caused more deaths since 1890 than bushfires, cyclones, earthquakes, floods and severe storms combined.</p> <p>Although they have always been with us in Australia, extremely hot days are now far more frequent. Just a couple of weeks ago, all grade cricket matches in Sydney were <a href=\"http://www.cricketnsw.com.au/news/heatwave/2017-02-10\">cancelled</a> for what was <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/heat-takes-toll-with-all-sydney-grade-cricket-at-the-weekend-called-off/news-story/6cf610b825afc664f7b7f6ebab984f30\">reported</a> to be the first time in the competition\u2019s history, in order to protect the welfare of players, umpires and volunteers from the extreme heat which scientists say was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/angry-summer-report\">driven</a> by global warming. </p> <p>As Cricket NSW doctor John Orchard noted, \u201cgrade cricket does not have the infrastructure in place to safely monitor and manage heatstroke in what is essentially an amateur, volunteer-run organisation\u201d.</p> <p>The disproportionate impact of extreme heat on amateur cricket is particularly ironic, given CommBank\u2019s recent \u201crealignment\u201d of its sponsorship of Cricket Australia (explained <a href=\"http://mcsaatchi.com.au/work/cba-cricket/\">here</a> in a briefing by Saatchi) to a greater focus on support for the game at a community level. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/20/elon-musk-port-augusta-four-renewable-energy-projects\">Elon Musk, meet Port Augusta: four renewable energy projects ready to go</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Commonwealth Bank\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/docs/sustainability-20151103-group-environment-policy.pdf\">group environment policy</a> publicly supports the 2015 Paris Agreement and its goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C.

If CommBank doesn\u2019t want its brand to be associated with cricket matches being cancelled and players collapsing or pissing in their pants from heatstroke \u2013 quite apart from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef\">bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef</a> and all the broader impacts of global warming \u2013 then it is time to get out of investing in fossil fuels.</p> <p>Last week two former Australian cricket captains \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/16/ian-and-greg-chappell-call-on-adani-to-abandon-carmichael-mine-project\">Ian and Greg Chappell</a> \u2013 were among 91 prominent signatories to a letter calling on Adani to abandon the Carmichael mine project. </p> <p>In explaining his opposition to Adani\u2019s plans, Ian Chappell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/17/ian-chappell-stands-by-adani-mine-letter-despite-being-called-elitist-by-coalition-mp\">said</a> \u201cyou don\u2019t need to be Einstein when you see the frequency and the ferocity of some of the weather events that we\u2019ve been having\u201d.</p> <p> If CommBank wants the trust of cricketers and cricket lovers of Australia, it needs to rule out any future involvement with the Carmichael mine and stop investing in the fossil fuel projects which threaten the health and enjoyment of all those who play and support our national game.</p> <p><em>\u2013 David Ritter is the CEO of Greenpeace Australia Pacific</em></p>",

Selznick was of course very talented, but his elevation inspired the eternal Hollywood gag: The Son-in-Law Also Rises.</p> <p>The favoured relative inspires suspicion and resentment in the hearts of colleagues \u2013 and finally, mysteriously, in the heart of the aged patron himself.

(\u201cThanks so much to everyone for all your lovely comments about my recent article\u201d; \u201cThanks so much to the fans whose support inspires me and have put my new album/film/TV show/dating app straight in at number one\u201d.) It was while gobbling down fiction over Christmas and New Year that I realised that acknowledgments sections are the source of some world-class thankbrags.</p> <p>After powering through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/24/conclave-by-robert-harris-review\" title=\"\">Robert Harris\u2019s addictive and gripping thriller, Conclave</a>, about the election of a new pope, I chanced upon the following: \u201cAt the outset of my research I asked the Vatican for permission to visit the locations used during a conclave that are permanently closed to the public. I am grateful to Monsignor Guillermo Karcher of the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff for arranging my visit.\u201d Does that mean permission was granted? And that the author saw things denied to \u201cthe public\u201d? I guess so. In which case: what\u2019s the point of hiding your light under a bushel and thanking Monsignor Karcher for general unspecified help? If anyone has earned thankbragging rights, it\u2019s Harris.</p> <h2><strong>Sausages and shame</strong></h2> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n01/alan-bennett/diary\" title=\"\">his annual London Review of Books diary</a>, Alan Bennett has put his finger on a contemporary nightmare: stuffing yourself at the hotel breakfast buffet. If you\u2019ve got bed-and-breakfast inclusive rates, the temptation to go mad is sometimes overwhelming: \u201cSome of the well-to-do guests can\u2019t wait to get the food back from the breakfast bar to their table, one young man downing a tumbler of orange juice en route and a boy stuffing himself with sausages before he even sits down.\u201d</p> <p>Comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/08/michael-mcintyre-big-show-saturday-night-tv\" title=\"\">Michael McIntyre</a> has also commented on middle-class behaviour at the breakfast buffet: how guests feel the urge to sit down at their tables pointlessly for a microsecond, before jumping up and galloping over to the eggs and bacon. At many a film festival I have disgraced myself by trying to curate, secretly, two separate picnic meals for lunch and dinner from the breakfast buffet \u2013 casually draping magazines and papers over my table so the disorder supposedly disguises the activity of wrapping bananas and slices of Parma ham in various paper napkins.

And yes, that previous sentence is part of it. It\u2019s about all the things the human brain does weirdly, illogically and just plain wrong. As a result, I\u2019ve ended up talking to a lot of people about the brain, from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b070fdhv\">Libby Purves</a> to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03kc6jn\">Steve Wright</a> to <a href=\"https://amp.twimg.com/v/dea2bb5e-0ef3-4dca-85f2-32b43b2e5a1c\">Tim Lovejoy</a>, so I\u2019ve been asked many questions about it. </p> <p>However, these people are professionals; it\u2019s when you take questions from the general public or more \u201calternative\u201d media, that\u2019s when things get bizarre. My favourites so far are:</p> <ul> <li>Which are smarter, tigers or wolves?<br /></li> <li>How does astrology work?<br /></li> <li>Do we have free will or not?<br /></li> <li>Why do I have epilepsy?<br /></li> <li>What\u2019s up with vaccines?<br /></li> <li>My laptop wasn\u2019t working and I had a dream about how to fix it, and I tried the fix and it worked, so how did that happen?<br /></li> </ul> <p>Technically, I\u2019m not trained to answer these question (assuming answers even exist). For the record, <a href=\"http://orca.cf.ac.uk/54380/\">I\u2019ve a PhD in memory processing</a>. Obviously, if I\u2019m going to put myself out there as an authority on things then I should expect questions. A fair point. </p> <p>However, even during school and university, I\u2019d regularly get asked things I had no ability to answer. They often weren\u2019t even about neuroscience, but things like \u201chow do radio waves travel through space?\u201d, or \u201cif evolution is true, why don\u2019t people have wings?\u201d (That last one is real). </p> <p>Other scientists I\u2019ve spoken to report similar, regular occurrences. It\u2019s just something people do. If you\u2019re a doctor, people you meet ask you to look at their rashes/lumps. If you\u2019re a comedian, people you meet say \u201ctell us a joke\u201d. And if you\u2019re a scientist, people assume you know <em>all</em> science, something which would likely require several lifetimes of study. </p> <p>In truth, most <a href=\"http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/\">professional scientists are very specialist</a>. This is true for most fields of expertise. If you meet a professional historian who specialises in the Victorian era, asking them how ancient Egyptians stored their grain would be illogical. Maybe this does happen to historians? I can\u2019t say. It happens to scientists though. </p> <p>So where does this \u201cscientists know all science\u201d preconception come from? And why does it persist?

But the ways in which it handles information could lead to this weird preconception of the omniscient scientist. Our brains, in fairness, have to deal with a lot of information, so often uses short cuts and generalisations, things like <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/hindex/g/heuristic.htm\">heuristics</a>. </p> <p>Heuristics are basically the brain\u2019s way of using short cuts when it comes to decision making and problem solving. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization\">How we categorise the information we encounter is tricky enough as it is</a>, but heuristics help us just clump information together in functionally useful ways. </p> <p>You can see how this would lead to inaccuracies or even <a href=\"https://sites.psu.edu/psych256su14/2014/09/08/12345/\">prejudices</a> though. In this case, if someone struggles to understand science, they would mentally lump the totality of it together as \u201cstuff I don\u2019t understand\u201d. Same goes for encountering scientists, they may label them as \u201cpeople who understand things I don\u2019t\u201d without any of the specifics or nuances of it. </p> <p>However, these preconceptions are likely to originate from somewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b36736c08c4446422e3946dafcd805a727a37fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b36736c08c4446422e3946dafcd805a727a37fd/27_0_3473_2086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Embargoed to 0001 Tuesday March 1 File photo dated 06/07/11 of children raising their hands to answer a question, as growing teacher shortages are having a damaging impact on children\u2019s education, according to the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL).

So you start off with this notion that science is just one \u201cthing\u201d, and have to gradually figure out otherwise. </p> <p>However, despite the <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/discussion/school-starting-age-the-evidence\">debate over what age is best to start formal education</a>, nobody argues that the things you learn at a very young age are extremely important and <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/150356-how-education-affects-early-child-development/\">shape your development and later life</a>. However, the existence of countless <a href=\"http://www.stemnet.org.uk/\">STEM</a> campaigns and organisations reveals that it\u2019s a lot of work to get children interested in science and related subjects. Would it be surprising then, if many people never really move on from the \u201cscience as one homogenous lump\u201d phase due to a disinterest in science, and regard scientists as interchangeable as a consequence?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cce32ce3751dcdba3dfd59e1cb64c1741dfb52c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cce32ce3751dcdba3dfd59e1cb64c1741dfb52c/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New Day launchCopies of the UK\u2019s first new stand-alone national newspaper in three decades, The New Day, are seen on sale in central London.

Any study or finding worth mentioning is invariably attributed to all scientists everywhere, so it\u2019s understandable if the average reader ends up thinking they\u2019re one and the same. </p> <p>There\u2019s also the narrative of <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-10/the-myth-of-the-lone-genius\">the \u201clone genius\u201d too</a>, which is a popular one. Your usual lesson or story about scientists typically focus on a single, brilliant (invariably male) intellectual, changing the world via his all-encompassing genius. While this makes for an inspiring narrative, it\u2019s a far cry from the collaborative effort most science is the result of. </p> <p>And this doesn\u2019t even include fictional scientists. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018ttws\">Sherlock</a>, <a href=\"http://house.wikia.com/wiki/House,_M.D.\">House MD</a>, <a href=\"http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Man\">Tony Stark</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scully\">Dana Scully</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)\">Donatello</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brains_(Thunderbirds)\">Brains</a>, <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Seven_of_Nine\">Seven of Nine</a>, even <a href=\"http://scoobydoo.wikia.com/wiki/Velma_Dinkley\">Velma</a>, it seems you can\u2019t go 10 minutes in pop culture fiction without encountering some genius who knows everything about everything, usually in very helpful and plot-relevant ways.

Some scientists, maybe unintentionally, often make declarations about other fields which don\u2019t stack up with what the evidence says. I know I\u2019ve done it myself in previous posts, judging by the comments I\u2019ve had. I see it often, in pop science books where the author strays into issues of psychology and neuroscience, areas that they aren\u2019t that familiar with but which need to be addressed in order to provide a coherent narrative. In many ways, books are maybe not the best format to communicate how science works. </p> <p>Except mine of course, <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-idiot-brain/dean-burnett/9781783350810\">mine is great</a>. </p> <p>But also, sadly, you get the scientists who achieve influence and prestige (maybe by <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/32287/title/All-s-Not-Fair-in-Science-and-Publishing/\">taking more credit than they deserve</a>) who start to believe their own press, and end up making declarations about fields beyond their own, using confidence instead of actual awareness of how things work. </p> <p>A very recent example came from the Guardian itself with an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/how-to-raise-a-brilliant-child-without-screwing-them-up\">article by Oliver James</a>, about how genetics don\u2019t influence intelligence. Whatever James\u2019s skills as a psychologist, his genetics knowledge seems, at best, seriously limited, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomChivers/status/704240329751465984\">several</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamRutherford/status/704233635893911552\">scientists</a> have pointed out. But he has a platform, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2016/feb/10/opinion-vs-facts-why-do-celebrities-so-often-get-it-wrong\">must be right, yeah</a>?</p> <p>Fact is, the idea that scientists know all science is a useful one for many, so isn\u2019t disputed, maybe even actively encouraged. If scientists really did know everything, they\u2019d know how to stop this. But they don\u2019t.

          "body": "<p>Last month, some of the brightest talents and most exciting advances in African science were on display at the <a href=\"http://gg2016.nef.org/\">Next Einstein Forum</a>. This landmark meeting, initiated by the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and held in Senegal, brought together almost 1000 researchers, entrepreneurs, businesses and policymakers from across Africa to celebrate and support the continent\u2019s most promising early-career researchers.</p> <p>A new cadre of fifteen <a href=\"http://nef.org/nef-fellows/\">Next Einstein Fellows</a> and fifty-four ambassadors was announced, and the forum ended with an upbeat <a href=\"http://nef.org/gg2016/dakar-declaration/\">declaration of commitment</a> to Africa\u2019s role in world-leading, locally-relevant science. This was accompanied by a call for greater investment by African governments in STEM education, particularly for young women. The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/africa-s-elite-1.19558  http://www.nature.com/news/africa-s-elite-1.19558  http://www.nature.com/news/africa-s-elite-1.19558\">journal Nature was impressed</a>, noting in an editorial that \u201cthis forum was significant. It showed what powerful commitment there is to be tapped in this emerging generation of young African scientists.\u201d </p> <p>Optimism about science in Africa has <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/africa-science-plan-attacked-1.15451 \">ebbed and flowed over recent years</a>, as strategies and targets have emerged with a fanfare, only to be quietly dropped in the face of more pressing priorities. But <a href=\"http://en.unesco.org/node/252168\">UNESCO\u2019s latest global audit of science</a>, published at the end of 2015, concludes that <a href=\"http://www.scidev.net/sub-saharan-africa/r-d/analysis-blog/africa-analysis-continent-science-making-progress.html\">African science is firmly on the rise</a>. The number of journal articles published on the continent rose by sixty per cent from 2008 to 2014. Research investment rose from $12.9 billion in 2007 to $19.9 billion (US dollars) in 2013. Over the same period, R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of GDP nudged upwards from 0.36 per cent to 0.45 per cent, and the population of active researchers expanded from 150,000 to 190,000. </p> <p>As the volume and quality of African research grows, more attention is being paid to how it is being used, and what structures exist to bring evidence and expertise into decision making. Here, the landscape is uneven. National academies of science are now used as a source of policy advice in several countries. A few (including South Africa, Zambia, Nigeria and Egypt) have appointed science advisory councils. Chief scientists or ministerial advisors are far more rare. A recent review by Thiambi Netshiluvhi of South Africa\u2019s Department of Science and Technology found \u201cinadequate capacity\u201d and \u201cpoor use of diverse structures\u201d for scientific advice in a majority of African countries.</p> <p>Now a new network has been launched to boost capacity at the science-policy interface.<a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/ingsa-news/ingsa-africa-chapter-under-development/\"> INGSA-Africa</a> is an offshoot of the <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/\">International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA)</a>, itself established in 2014, following the first <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/ingsa-news/2014-conference/\">global summit on science advice to governments</a>.</p> <p>With backing from the <a href=\"http://www.icsu.org/icsu-africa/about-icsu-roa/about-us\">International Council for Science</a>, INGSA-Africa aims to support scientists, policymakers, practitioners and national academies to share experience, build capacity and strengthen the use of scientific evidence in policy across the continent. Its launch follows a successful <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/ingsa-news/new-south-african-capacity-building-workshop/\">training workshop for early-career scientists</a>, which took place in South Africa at the end of February 2016, with participants from fourteen African countries. </p> <p>That workshop had space for only forty-five scientists, but almost six hundred applied to attend, suggesting a level of unmet demand which INGSA-Africa will try to address. Further training sessions are planned for Senegal, Ethiopia and Egypt, and teaching materials are being developed, using real policy dilemmas to highlight how scientific advice can operate in practice. Several of the founding members of INGSA-Africa will also participate in the next global summit on scientific advice to governments, which will take place <a href=\"http://www.ingsa.org/events/2016-conference/\">in Brussels in September 2016</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://nef.org/nef-fellows/tolu-oni/\">Tolu Oni</a> is involved both in INGSA-Africa, as a member of its steering group, and the Next Einstein Forum, as one of its newly appointed fellows. Dr Oni, who works as a senior lecturer in public health medicine at the University of Cape Town, says that science advice is now high on the agenda in South Africa. She wants INGSA-Africa to play a role \u201cin coordinating efforts and developing a more structured, methodological approach to the ways we do it.\u201d Over time, she suggests it \u201chas the potential to become the go-to network for training, so that academies, young academies and others use it to develop the skills of the next generation of scientific advisers. Science advice is a skill and it can be taught.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pmcsa.org.nz/a-short-biography-of-peter-gluckman/\">Sir Peter Gluckman</a>, New Zealand\u2019s chief scientist and founding chair of the International Network for Government Science Advice, agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of insight, skill and energy across Africa\u2019s science community that can help to develop robust advisory processes. I\u2019m impressed by the group of scientists who have taken this on, and look forward to INGSA-Africa making an important contribution.\u201d </p> <p>Of course, science in Africa still faces huge challenges of deep inequalities, under-investment, weak infrastructure and brain drain. But as the Next Einstein Forum showcased so well, there are a growing number of people, places and projects that give reasons to be optimistic. And as Africa\u2019s research base strengthens, the next task is to bring more of its evidence and expertise into decision making, in ways that can help to meet local priorities and <a href=\"http://www.globalgoals.org/\">global goals</a>.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameswilsdon\">James Wilsdon</a> is professor of research policy</em><em> in the <a href=\"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/faculty/social-sciences\">Faculty of Social Sciences at the </a><a>University of Sheffield</a>, and vice-chair of the International Network for Government Science Advice.</em></p>",

With titles in the running including A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, George Orwell\u2019s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, and Adam Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations, Darwin\u2019s explanation of his theory of evolution was the public\u2019s overwhelming favourite, with 26% of the vote, said organisers.</p> <p>Professor Andrew Prescott of the University of Glasgow called Darwin\u2019s 1859 study \u201cthe supreme demonstration of why academic books matter\u201d. \u201cDarwin used meticulous observation of the world around us, combined with protracted and profound reflection, to create a book which has changed the way we think about everything \u2013 not only the natural world, but religion, history and society,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery researcher, no matter whether they are writing books, creating digital products or producing artworks, aspires to produce something as significant in the history of thought as Origin of Species.\u201d</p> <p>On the Origin of Species was followed in the public vote by The Communist Manifesto and The Complete Works of Shakespeare, with Plato\u2019s The Republic fourth, and Immanuel Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason fifth - a choice heralded by the Booksellers Association\u2019s Alan Staton. \u201cWe seem to be governed by expediency and doublethink and it\u2019s reassuring to know that Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative is known and thought important,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Philosopher Roger Scruton agreed. \u201cI am gratified that the Critique of Pure Reason, which must be surely one of the most difficult works of philosophy ever written, should have been chosen as among the most influential of all academic books,\u201d he said of the 18th-century text.</p> <p>\u201cKant set out on an extraordinary task, which was to show the limits of human reasoning, and at the same time to justify the use of our intellectual powers within those limits. The resulting vision, of self-conscious beings enfolded within a one-sided boundary, but always pressing against it, hungry for the inaccessible beyond, has haunted me, as it has haunted many others since Kant first expressed it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The top 20</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2013/sep/19/stephen-hawking-history-time-simple-video\">A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/oct/05/original-suffragette-mary-wollstonecraft\">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/17/immanuel-kant-philosophical-argument-shot\">Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/19/100-best-novels-1984-george-orwell-nineteen-eighty-four-robert-mccrum\">Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/09/darwin.bestseller\">On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/13/middleeast.israelandthepalestinians\">Orientalism by Edward Said</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-anniversary\">Silent Spring by Rachel Carson</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/apr/25/karl-marx-communist-manifesto\">The Communist Manifesto</a> by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels<br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/14/classics.shopping\">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/oct/27/female-eunuch-40-years-on\">The Female Eunuch by Germaine Greer</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/26/in-praise-making-english-working-class\">The Making of the English Working Class</a> by EP Thompson<br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/05/einstein-equation-emc2-special-relativity-alok-jha\">The Meaning of Relativity </a>by Albert Einstein<br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/18/scienceandnature.science\">The Naked Ape by Desmond Morris</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/mar/26/machiavelli-prince-power-good-evil\">The Prince by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/05/shopping.plato\">The Republic by Plato</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview3\">The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/08/top10s.debeauvoir\">The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/class-richard-hoggart-social-media\">The Uses of Literacy by Richard Hoggart</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/audio/2011/oct/06/big-ideas-podcast-adam-smith-audio\">The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/sep/07/ways-seeing-berger-tv-programme-british\">Ways of Seeing by John Berger</a></p>",

It was engaging and intriguing as well as being funny and emotional at times. The ending was moving as well as satisfying and it made me feel exceedingly happy for Al and his family. I adored the character of grandpa Byron who is an exceptionally likeable person, and a very well developed character who made the story more lighthearted in places. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c84d9588f6613d416b9e3bcb94b8017bda50f247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c84d9588f6613d416b9e3bcb94b8017bda50f247/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"Time Travelling with a Hamster\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overall this is a brilliant story which is very hard to find fault in; it kept me pondering over the mind boggling concept of time travel, which is made about as believable as it ever could be by Ross Welford, for long after I finished the story.

          "body": "<p>\u201cIf you want to learn about acting,\u201d the playwright Peter Gill told me, \u201ctalk to Luise Rainer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Luise Rainer?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Peter corrected my ignorance and told me Rainer, then 99, lived in Vivien Leigh\u2019s old building in Eaton Square, London. I watched The Great Ziegfeld and wrote to her immediately saying I was an actor and would love to meet her. My mother lived nearby and I offered myself up as a neighbour, a potential bearer of milk and biscuits, foolishly imagining a sort of abandoned princess living in penury. I walked to Belgravia and delivered my letter to the building with the blue plaque. Two days later a deep and ancient German voice was on the phone inviting me to tea.</p> <p>When I arrived at the top floor flat in my best suit (not at all the hovel I had imagined, but a bourgeois flat full of paintings and antiques) Luise was approaching slowly down the length of her hallway in her presentation outfit of silk trouser suit and a gold toque. She gave an impatient order to her Filipino maid and then spread her arms wide with a great curious smile and embraced me. She used a walking frame but there was still something jaunty and girlish about her, an attitude sent out from her hips and wrists. An actor to her bones. She set about scolding me for the state of my hair and my disgusting shoes, which she made me leave at the door \u2013 this became routine whenever I visited.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"767bea358c3570fd328518b17fbe997184db635d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/6/1420544973137/67dff06d-4de2-4ae3-a678-53c46ae5b71d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Luise Rainer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luise celebrates in 2011 after receiving a golden star on the Boulevard of Stars in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soeren Stache/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the living room was tea, cheesecake and champagne and, as we talked, with difficulty because of her failing hearing, she held my hand and urged me to fill and refill my champagne glass. She enjoyed the excuse for half a glass and drank it with all the delight of a schoolgirl with forbidden hooch.</p> <p>To my predictable Hollywood questions she gave humorous and well-kept replies. She was kind about her ex-husband Clifford Odets, she didn\u2019t think much of Clark Gable, she adored William Powell and Paul Muni and John Gilbert. \u201cBut I hardly remember, it was all so long ago.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes turned serious when she spoke about her early theatre days in Germany with Max Reinhardt. At the time I was rehearsing to play Lucio in a touring production of Measure for Measure but the woman clutching my hand had played Isabella in that play under Reinhardt\u2019s direction. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/18/bertolt-brecht-arturo-ui-revival\">Brecht</a> (\u201crevolting man but a great writer\u201d) had written Grusha in The Caucasian Chalk Circle for her.</p> <p>I was embarrassed by the the contrast between my ungainly struggles as an actor and her natural ascent to the heights of the profession. But she knew how to enchant a man and it was almost a relief when she changed the subject to my girlfriends and quizzed me about love and sex, all the time squeezing my hand and laughing with her great eyes. These were favourite subjects and she would counsel me and reprimand me, always referring to her second husband as the perfect man, who had kept her love and faithfulness simply by noticing, but never forbidding, any attachments that she might be forming.</p> <p>She had a startling energy driven by a curiosity that was evidently a factor in her longevity. It was a huge frustration to her that her faculties were failing but her eyes \u2013 those watery lamps that had made her famous \u2013 held out, and she always tried to see the latest exhibitions. She was full of delight about the Hammersh\u00f8i show at the Royal Academy on that first meeting, and she talked about painting as though it sustained her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"572280f8a07fc5b0b6b282d6ac6e853fc5577dd5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/6/1420545548499/997b7376-c9cc-4955-9230-b8ffdcf36701-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Luise Rainer in The Good Earth\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In The Good Earth with Paul Muni in 1937.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She showed me her own art in her study, collages of objects, and nearby on a shelf in the corner her two best actress Oscars, won in 1937 (for The Great Ziegfeld) and 1938 (for The Good Earth) \u2013 the year of my dad\u2019s birth, a fact that boggled my mind. And over by the sofa a picture of her arm in arm with Einstein, on the beach. When she spoke about Einstein she was modest about their friendship, remembering above all how much he made her laugh.</p> <p>Her impishness could turn to fierceness in a second. She asked me to take her to the Gauguin exhibition at the Tate and after I picked her up in my car she grew furious at the route I was taking and began to direct me at every turn. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jan/16/gauguin-tate-modern-crowds\">At the crowded show</a> I wheeled her about in a wheelchair trying to find a gap to see the paintings through. Luise simply hit anyone in the way, bashing them in the ankles with her walking stick. When they turned around to see who was attacking them the lamps were already lit and fixed on the Tahitians.</p> <p>\u201cQuite flat,\u201d she said afterwards of Gauguin\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably not possible to learn how to act by talking to an actor, not over champagne and cheesecake anyhow, but it seemed to me that her strength, which contradicted her demeanour, protected something very delicate inside her. Her eyes expressed a very refined sensibility. Her personal style was simple, almost tomboyish, but her emotions on screen were ornate. To some her acting seems overexpressive or too fraught, but her imagination led to overwhelming identification with the women she played and there was a hard core of truth to it. She would say simply: \u201cYou must be inside the person.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k86Fj85sBIM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k86Fj85sBIM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>She represented what to me is an old-fashioned idea of the artist as someone who must be kept apart from the fray, protected from base things, surrounded by special people. Perhaps that makes her sound grand but she was just a bohemian from another era, more modern than the present in many ways, the unconventionality and delight in life not simply a posture but a hard won defiance.</p> <p>Her never ceasing dismay at my clothes and the state of my hair was of a piece with that sensibility. She had a horror of coarseness and triviality, of people who valued money or talked business and I imagine those things were two parts to one in the Hollywood cocktail. By picking the fight with Louis B Mayer that ended her career in Hollywood she was protecting her art, not surrendering it. And of course she wasn\u2019t prepared to baste the turkeys which Mayer started sending her way. A very good lesson, and a hard one to follow. Thumbing her nose in the way that she did tells you quite how strong she was. She was deadly serious about acting.</p> <p>My time with her always felt like a special occasion. She asked me to accompany her to a reception at the Mexican embassy for Carlos Fuentes, another of the many great men she knew. I combed my hair and tried to provide ballast but after my fourth margarita I\u2019m not sure who was holding on to whom. Fuentes approached with Eric Hobsbawm and introduced him to Luise. Neither nonagenarian could hear a word the other said but enough was made clear as they grinned and chuckled at each other, apparently delighted by the ridiculousness of their great ages.</p> <p>As she approached her birthday, she would say: \u201cNo one should be 100 years old. It\u2019s absurd!\u201d</p> <p>But her impish energy, mischief and curt humour was fully present during her centenary celebrations despite how tired she complained they made her. After a showing of The Great Ziegfeld at the NFT she turned to the audience from the front row, swept her arm across the span of the auditorium and smiled. Her eyes lit up the room just as they had on the screen and I realised \u2013 that sort of enchantment is not something you can learn.</p>",

As a result, the bank fired more than 5,300 employees. The bank denies that the creation of these accounts was part of an orchestrated effort. </p> <p>According to bank\u2019s critics, the bank\u2019s staff opened such unauthorized accounts in order to meet their sales quotas. The bank announced yesterday that it is terminating all of its sales quotas starting 1 October.</p> <p>In light of this scandal, Chiang\u2019s office has effective immediately suspended its investment in all Wells Fargo securities, use of Wells Fargo as a broker-dealer for investment purchases and use of Wells Fargo as managing underwriter on negotiated sales of California state bonds. </p> <p>These sanctions are in effect for 12 months during which Chiang asked that Wells Fargo quarterly report back its compliance with the terms of its $185m settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Los Angeles city attorney, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p> <p>Chiang has also called for separation of the chief executive and chair positions at Wells Fargo \u2013 both of which are currently held by John Stumpf, a review of Wells Fargo\u2019s compensation practices and clawbacks of pay for those executives who are linked to the predatory sales practices.</p> <p>\u201cWells Fargo has diligently and professionally worked with the state for the past 17 years to support the government and people of California. Our highly experienced and proven government banking, securities and treasury management teams stand ready to continue delivering outstanding service to the state,\u201d a Wells Fargo spokesperson told the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cWe certainly understand the concerns that have been raised. We are very sorry and take full responsibility for the incidents in our retail bank<strong>. </strong>We have already taken important steps<strong>, </strong>and will continue to do so<strong>,</strong> to address these issues and rebuild your trust.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>Well then. Nobody knows anything any more, do they? Michael Gove was mocked for saying that everyone was sick of experts (or thereabouts), and I\u2019ve always been sympathetic to that mocking, but it is starting to seem as though \u2013 in political predictions at least \u2013 he has a point. There\u2019s so much received wisdom about how to win a key marginal, and what will alienate the middle ground, and why you ignore this demographic or that at your peril. And yet, after the shock of Thursday, none of that received wisdom seems to be so wise any more.</p> <h2>1. Young people do turn out</h2> <p>I\u2019ll admit it. I was sceptical. Despite seeing evidence of great enthusiasm for Corbyn among the young (we all saw it: rallies, fashion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2017/jun/07/grime4corbyn-ive-never-trusted-a-politician-before\">grime4corbyn</a>), I was cynical about whether that would translate to turnout. I thought it would be bigger, but maybe not huge. We don\u2019t know just how high the 18-24 turnout was yet, and won\u2019t do so for around a week, so don\u2019t believe that 72% stat doing the rounds on social media. But it\u2019s clear that young people flocked to the polls more than ever before, breaking a trend that has existed in UK politics since \u2013 well, for ever. Let\u2019s hope that this enthusiasm among young people lasts. As Laura Kuenssberg said on the BBC last night: \u201cThis is the election where young people started voting. And it may seem that for all the political parties the demographics of who they have to please might be shifting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ladyhaja/status/872948997371113473\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;This is the election young people started voting.&quot; \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\u270a\ufe0f And wouldn&#39;t this be wonderful? -&gt; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBCelection?src=hash\">#BBCelection</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Election2017?src=hash\">#Election2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ycfr2wC6zH\">pic.twitter.com/ycfr2wC6zH</a></p>&mdash; HannahJane Parkinson (@ladyhaja) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladyhaja/status/872948997371113473\">June 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. Newspapers don\u2019t rule all</h2> <p>Well, well, well. Poor Dacre. Poor Murdoch. Paul Dacre, the Daily Mail\u2019s editor and Theresa May\u2019s cheerleader, has seen his savage, relentless campaign against Labour fall flat. This is a paper that the day before the polls ran 13 pages of febrile anti-Labour content, and splashed: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/07/daily-mail-devotes-13-pages-to-attack-on-labour-apologists-for-terror\">APOLOGISTS FOR TERROR</a>\u201d on page one. This is a lot, in the wake of two terrorist attacks. It\u2019s a lot, whatever you think of Corbyn\u2019s associations in the past, to scream all of that about a man who stood on a stage in Manchester at a memorial for the dead. In other words: read the room, Mail. The hyperbole and frenzied attacks may well have been too much for some people to stomach. Ditto the Sun\u2019s consistent bile towards Diane Abbott, which echoed the Tory party\u2019s rhetoric. (Murdoch was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnprescott/status/872957575788101632\">said to be</a> so incensed at how the election played out he stormed out from an office.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/09/tabloids-crush-corbyn-power-politics-sun-mail-labour\">The Sun and Mail tried to crush Corbyn.

I argued just the other day that having those sorts of headlines above the fold, in newsagents across the country, is a huge advantage \u2013 perhaps I was wrong. Could this be another blow to the dominance of the rightwing press? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/09/tabloids-crush-corbyn-power-politics-sun-mail-labour\">Is the grip finally weakening</a>? </p> <h2>3. The party seen as strongest on the economy might not always win?</h2> <p>Labour, to a certain extent historically, but especially after the Tories tried to pin the global financial crash on Brown\u2019s administration, has been viewed as not, to coin a phrase, strong and stable on the economy. It\u2019s always the party that is seen as the strongest on the economy, the most responsible with the purse strings that wins. And actually, that is true of this result, but who expected Labour to give such a run for its, er, money. If Corbyn\u2019s Labour can do this well in the polls despite the voters being told every single day that he was recklessly profligate and endless talk of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/06/magic-money-tree-theresa-may-banks-nurses\">magic money tree</a>\u201d, then that represents a shift. (And somehow the Tories managed to get away without costing a single one of their policies, aside from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/24/theresa-may-free-school-breakfasts-undercosted-tory-manifesto\">free school breakfasts</a>, which they got massively wrong.

The in-crowd doesn\u2019t know everything</h2> <p>The polls, mostly, were wrong. Even the exit polls underestimated Labour\u2019s strength. The pundits were wrong. People like me didn\u2019t think Corbyn could do this well, I admit it. Talking heads shook them, and said never in a million years. Even the politicians themselves got it wrong \u2013 until late last night, Labour itself was braced for something of a wipeout, with talk coming from aides that Labour candidates were drafting concession speeches. It\u2019s become obvious that there\u2019s a whole chunk of the electorate that polling, canvassing, aides and tellers aren\u2019t picking up on. They might be hiding (shy voters fudging answers in polls, and so on), or they might be hiding in plain sight (see Corbyn\u2019s massive online army, for instance).</p> <h2>6.

          "body": "<h2><strong>Back in Time for Christmas</strong><br />9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>A lesson in festive nostalgia, as the Robshaw family step back in time to celebrate Christmas over six decades under the guidance of Giles Coren. They begin in 1940, with wartime austerity and Christmas dinner on the rationing list. Lionel Blair pops in to tell them stories of singing for people using the London Underground as an air-raid shelter. There is also a glimpse of 1950s optimism, followed by cocktail parties, carols and the arrival of the artificial Christmas tree in the 1960s. Concludes Tuesday with the 70s, 80s and 90s. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2><strong>Our Guy in Latvia</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Guy Martin is best known as a daredevil with a penchant for breaking land-speed records. Tonight, however, he undertakes a slower, more personal journey: back to the Baltics, to find out the truth about his late grandfather Walter Kidals. How did Walter make it from German-occupied Latvia to postwar Hull to marry Martin\u2019s grandmother? The story involves stirring feats of Boy\u2019s Own derring-do, including audacious prison camp escapes, that put even Martin\u2019s own adventures in the shade. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2><strong>Inside Einstein\u2019s Mind: The Enigma of Space and Time</strong><br />9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>A century ago last month, the 36-year-old physicist Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity, embedding himself in popular culture as the cliche of the dishevelled boffin and dramatically expanding humankind\u2019s understanding of the universe. This terrific film illuminates not only Einstein\u2019s conclusions but also the means by which he arrived at them, adroitly negotiating that always\u2011difficult balance between bewildering and patronising the passing viewer to furnish an engrossing narrative. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Trollied<br />9pm, Sky1</h2> <p>It\u2019s nearly Christmas at Valco and fruit-recognition training is in full swing, while a poisonous spider is on the loose. In the second of the double bill, the supermarket\u2019s staff celebrate its birthday in 1960s fancy dress as the series bows out. There are some real gems in the ensemble cast, most notably Jason Watkins and Sarah Parish playing out Gavin\u2019s bittersweet romance with rival supermarket manager Cheryl in the store\u2019s freezer. Trollied is from the Stella school of comedy: not always hilarious, but gently watchable.<em> HV</em></p> <h2>Dr Christmas<br />9pm, TLC</h2> <p>It\u2019s time to deck the halls: unless you\u2019re an American kajillionaire, that is, in which case you may have already outsourced decorative duties to Bob Pranga, AKA Dr Christmas. This schmaltzy one-off follows the Doc and his business partner Debi as they bring ice rinks, monster trees and giant gingerbread men to Beverly Hills. In this opening episode, the not-so-secret Santa lends a hand to a former Saved by the Bell star, a soap actor and a TV presenter. Garish, obviously, but likely to induce a gleeful \u201cOMG\u201d or five, too. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Fargo</strong><br />10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>After perhaps the most taut moment of an impressive second series, and with the seemingly bullet-proof Peggy and Ed (Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons) somehow managing to live another day, you can\u2019t help but wonder whether the scene where they let the deadly assassin Hanzee escape could prove to be their eventual undoing. After arriving to save the day, Lou is now involved in jurisdictional politics, while Hanzee returns to the Gerhardt compound with news of recent events. That\u2019ll be awkward, then. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>The Best of Bad TV: The 70s <br />10pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>As the Christmas schedules creep on to Britain\u2019s EPGs, expect the annual parade of pundits pining for TV\u2019s 1970s golden age. While there may have been Morecambe and Wise, Fawlty Towers and Porridge, there was also room for rampant racism, sickening sexism and competitive disco dancing on Britain\u2019s three channels. Time for a showcase evening promoting the very worst the decade had to offer. Including interviews with Peter Purves, Valerie Singleton and Jane Rossington, AKA Jill from Crossroads. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>Lawless</strong> (John Hillcoat, 2012) 11.10pm, Film4</p> <p>More rough stuff from the director of the post-apocalyptic drama The Road and The Proposition. Apparently based on a true story, it\u2019s set in 1931 Virginia, where brothers Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf lead the Bondurant clan in their illegal moonshine business. Which is all very well until a corrupt, sadistic Fed (Guy Pearce) starts muscling in. Relentlessly violent. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>The Truman Show</strong> (Peter Weir, 1998) 2.05pm, 9.50pm, Sky Movies Greats</p> <p>Jim Carrey\u2019s Truman Burbank lives in the peaceful town of Seahaven, unaware that he is the subject of a round-the-clock TV show, his friends and family merely actors playing roles. It\u2019s an inspired idea and Weir plays it out brilliantly, with Ed Harris superb as the godlike show creator. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s best live sport</h2> <p><strong>International Premier Tennis League Micromax</strong> Indian Aces take on Japan Warriors before the Philippine Mavericks do battle with the UAE Royals. 12noon, Sky Sports 3</p> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Leicester City v Chelsea</strong> High-flying Foxes take on relegation-threatened Chelsea. 7pm, Sky Sports 1</p> <p><strong>Championship Football: Blackburn Rovers v Nottingham Forest</strong> Mid-table clash. 7.30pm, Sky Sports 5</p> <p><strong>American Football: Miami Dolphins v New York Giants </strong>NFL action. 1am, Sky Sports 1</p>",

There\u2019s apparently a painting inside of Muhammad pooping extremists, or so we hear in a very badly written <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/12/opinion/begala-stewart-blew-up-crossfire/\">Crossfire</a>-style news program that plays in the background (in Carter\u2019s defense, it would be hard to write dialogue worse than the invective pundits fling at each other on cable news), but isn\u2019t that too little motivation? Couldn\u2019t it be something more?</p> <p>No, apparently. We can believe in lizard people (come back, <a href=\"http://www.feralaudio.com/28-interview-with-x-files-writer-darin-morgan/\">Darin Morgan</a>!), but considering briefly that American Muslims might not be even less sympathetic monsters seems to be beyond the scope of this show\u2019s powers. Carter keeps trying to pretend he\u2019s not really taking a side in the debates he keeps bringing up, but he\u2019s bad at disingenuousness. Even the liberal commentator on the aforementioned news show seems to think that there\u2019s enmity between the west and the Middle East because there\u2019s too much blasphemy on TV and not because of bombs falling on hospitals.</p> <p>Mercifully, we cut to Mulder and Scully, who are trying to figure out another, more interesting mystery related to trumpets sounding out of the clear sky like something from the book of Revelation.</p> <h2>Separated at birth</h2> <p>The two are interrupted by Miller and Einstein (Lauren Ambrose and Robbie Amell), who look like Mulder and Scully would look if the show was on the CW and not Fox. The pair are nearly identical to their elders in temperament and of course Ambrose has bright red hair; it\u2019s one of several unexplained moments in the episode that give The X-Files its trademark panache.</p> <p>Mulder and Scully call Einstein and Miller \u2013 their partners\u2019 respective opposite numbers \u2013 and work out a creative solutions to what becomes the episode\u2019s central problem. That problem is an ingenious one: one of the terrorists has survived the bombing, but just barely. He\u2019s in a coma, and he may know something about the next attack.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not clear how the agents know there\u2019s going to be a next attack, unless you think that one terrorist is two terrorists. Even if we\u2019ve giving Carter credit for referencing the shooting at the Curtis Culwell Center (in which two men wounded one person in the ankle and immediately died in a hail of bullets outside the artistic fruit of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/04/officer-and-two-suspects-reportedly-shot-at-draw-the-prophet-contest-in-texas\">Draw Muhammad contest</a>), there certainly wasn\u2019t a corresponding cell of enthusiastic, multiracial suicide bombers, as there is in this episode.</p> <p>Mind you, the locals of south-west Texas are none too admirable either. A nurse tries to kill Shiraz (our comatose terrorist kid) and lectures Einstein about how the UN want to fill the country with immigrants. Later, two agents from the Department of Homeland Security (!) try to do the same out of a desire for revenge.</p> <h2>\u2018I saw powerful things\u2019</h2> <p>The episode all comes down to both Mulder and Scully going off the reservation. Scully wants to talk to the young man using an MRI to see if she can read his brainwaves well enough to determine a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno\u201d; Mulder wants to trip on shrooms to see if the kid shows up in his hallucinations.</p> <p>As per, Scully\u2019s solution is more plausible but Mulder\u2019s is vastly more entertaining: while Scully and Miller work the medical angle, Mulder and a very dubious Einstein procure a caplet of hallucinogens and Mulder dances his way through a surreal sequence scored by Tom Waits, Billy Ray Cyrus and Trace Adkins, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNVguvNE7qc\">Honky Tonk Badonkadonk </a>fame, in which we see some familiar faces. \u201cYou were there!\u201d he tells Skinner after coming down. \u201cAnd the Lone Gunmen! And the badonkadonk!\u201d</p> <p>The punchline turns out to be that Einstein was too straitlaced to give Mulder illegal drugs and he\u2019s been tripping balls on vitamin B3; the further punchline is that it worked. Mulder recognizes the young man\u2019s mother \u2013 having seen her in the dream \u2013 as she tries to get inside the hospital and lets her come up to see him. Using Scully\u2019s brainwave translation method, they learn that he survived the bombing because he couldn\u2019t bring himself to detonate his vest.</p> <p>They also get a new clue: the Babylon hotel, where the rest of the United Terrorists of Benetton are hanging out (seriously, they look like if the <a href=\"http://www.whiffenpoofs.com/\">Whiffenpoofs</a> grew beards).</p> <p>A bunch of FBI agents raid the place, which is as neat a metaphor as needed for the way in which this whole exercise is so objectionable: if you\u2019re going to spend the next three minutes telling everyone how the episode was about all the ways love is better than hate \u2013 and trust me, Carter is \u2013 perhaps you ought not to shoot a climactic takedown sequence during which a bunch of guys in body armor waving huge guns around storm a roomful of praying Muslim men and step on their rugs. It tells a visual story I\u2019m not sure Carter knows he\u2019s telling.</p> <p>\u201cI saw things, though, Scully. Powerful things,\u201d Mulder says in the epilogue. \u201cI saw deep and unconditional love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw things, too,\u201d Scully replies. \u201cI witnessed unqualified hate that appears to have no end.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow to reconcile the two? The extremes of our nature?\u201d Mulder asks.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the question,\u201d Scully replies. \u201cMaybe the question of our times.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing: if you\u2019re going to reconcile the extremes of human nature, you could do worse than correctly identifying them first.</p>",

          "body": "<p>The psychodrama surrounding one of America\u2019s greatest 20th century poets during, and immediately after, the second world war is so bizarre, it\u2019s astonishing that this chapter in the life of the modernist, madman, fascist and traitor AKA Ezra Pound has remained largely neglected for so long.</p> <p>In <em>The Bughouse</em>, Daniel Swift has reconnoitred a unique but hardly obscure literary target. The deranged figure of Pound behind bars has been hiding in plain sight for decades. Still, it is Swift\u2019s considerable achievement sympathetically to examine an extraordinary, often troubling, tale in an idiosyncratic biographical analysis that marries lit crit and memoir in a sometimes awkward fusion.</p> <p>Swift describes Pound as \u201cthe most difficult man of the 20th century\u201d. Others called him \u201cthe Trotsky of literature\u201d. He was certainly a rag-bag of contradictions: a racist who believed in African myth and Chinese philosophy, and an antisemite whose 800-page <em>Cantos</em> is an unfinished masterpiece of renowned beauty and complexity. \u201cAs much as Freud or Einstein,\u201d writes Swift, he \u201cinvented the modern age. He edited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/12/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-46-ts-eliot-the-waste-land-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\"><em>The Waste Land</em></a>.\u201d He also played tennis \u201clike an inebriated kangaroo\u201d, revered the US constitution, but spent the second world war broadcasting anti-American propaganda from Mussolini\u2019s Italy.</p> <p>Pound on fascist radio was a disaster waiting to happen. Ever since 1913, when he\u2019d read poetry into a phonoscope (an obsolete recording device), he was fascinated by a medium whose disembodied polyphony, he claimed, echoed his own techniques. \u201cI anticipated the damn thing in the first third of the <em>Cantos</em>,\u201d he wrote. In December 1941, just before Pearl Harbor tipped America into war, Pound began a series of broadcasts from Rome, partly about poetry but, more fatally, also about the folly of fighting against the Axis powers. By the time he was indicted for treason, which carried the death penalty, he had broadcast more than 200 times.</p> <p>Pound\u2019s radio prose was like the man: chaotic, confusing, sometimes comic, but always \u2013 says Swift \u2013 \u201ca little sad\u201d with references to \u201ckikes\u201d, \u201cyids\u201d, and Tennyson, and rants against \u201cchief war pimp, Frankie Finkelstein Roosevelt\u201d, who had \u201cchucked away our national, cultural heritage\u201d. Far away in Maryland, federal eavesdroppers wrote it all down.</p> <p>Like PG Wodehouse who, in utterly different circumstances, fell foul of Nazi radio, Ezra Pound turned himself over to US forces who, in May 1945, slammed him into a brutal punishment camp with 3,500 rapists, murderers and deserters. His \u201cgorilla cage\u201d was 6ft by 6ft of steel bars with no shelter from the sun or rain. By the middle of June, Pound had suffered a nervous collapse. But then, like Oscar Wilde in Reading jail, he began to write himself into a state of grace. In November 1945, he was flown back to Washington\u00a0DC to face trial. On landing, he asked: \u201cDoes anyone have the faintest idea of what I actually said in Rome?\u201d</p> <p>Pound was sent to St Elizabeths, a government hospital for the insane where, after examination, he was found to be \u201cmentally unfit for trial\u201d. He would be kept in \u201cS Liz\u201d for nearly 13 years, sequestered in the place he called \u201cthe bughouse\u201d.</p> <p>St Elizabeths, writes Swift, became \u201cthe world\u2019s most unorthodox literary salon: convened by a fascist, held in a lunatic asylum\u201d. Pound became a destination for cultural pilgrims, a mad poet visited by other poets: TS\u00a0Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop, William Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore, ageing modernists and newer voices such as Frederick Seidel, some of whom were almost as \u201ccrazy\u201d as Pound. The resident of St Elizabeths became a kind of creative godfather to several, more or less unstable, US writers of the 1950s, from Anne Sexton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/24/happy-100th-birthday-john-berryman-poetry\" title=\"\">John Berryman </a>to Delmore Schwartz and Robert Lowell.</p> <p>But how mad was he, who had always been a holy fool? Was he faking dementia to avoid the death penalty? To some visiting psychiatrists, the man who, in 1945, called Hitler \u201ca martyr\u201d, mourned \u201cpoor Benito\u201d and declared Stalin \u201cthe best brain in the business\u201d appeared to be simply a genius. Hadn\u2019t Shakespeare, no less, found lunatics, lovers and poets to be \u201cof imagination all compact\u201d?</p> <p>Swift, echoing this, says that Pound \u201cencapsulates the central questions about art, politics and poetry, about the connection between experimental art and extreme political sentiment\u201d. Struggling for answers, he undertakes a prolonged analysis of the meetings between patient 58,102 (Pound\u2019s case-file number) and six major poets, led by Eliot. This makes for an enthralling narrative, but it does complicate an already cubist portrait of an impossible character. We might be better informed, but we are, in truth, not much the wiser about the enigma of \u201cUncle Ez\u201d.</p> <p>What\u2019s not in doubt is Pound\u2019s tragedy, or the cruelty meted out to him: the years spent among the criminally insane, the isolation and the terrible distress. At night, Pound would stop his ears with paper to block the mad cries of his fellows. \u201cI want quiet,\u201d he begged one doctor. \u201cYou must decide whether I am to be cured or punished.\u201d</p> <p>While the authorities struggled with this conundrum, some poets appealed to President Truman for clemency, while Pound himself withdrew into a distracted seclusion in which he could write and hold court. By 1952, we find him on the hospital tennis court, reminiscing with Eliot about Rupert Brooke. In 1953, Lowell reports him \u201cmuch fatter and healthier\u201d. Within another year, the publication of new work raised old questions about a poet who could adapt Confucian odes, but was not fit to stand trial.</p> <p>Simultaneously, with the passage of time, he was morphing from traitor to throwback. In 1951, Salinger published\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/02/100-best-novels-catcher-in-the-rye-jd-salinger-holden-caulfield\" title=\"\"><em>Catcher in the Rye</em></a>; Stalin died in 1953; in 1955, Ginsberg\u2019s <em>Howl</em>\u00a0signalled a new generation. While the 50s unspooled, Pound reached a kind of premature posterity in St Elizabeths.</p> <p>Many young poets who came to \u201cthe bughouse\u201d to practise \u201cEzrology\u201d, returned to the world in a state of ecstatic reinvention. Some espoused Pound\u2019s mad politics. Inevitably, a few young women fell in love with him. Conspiracy theorists debated his fate. Was he a traitor protected by the hospital from the punishment he deserved; or a truth-teller tormented for his candour ?</p> <p>Swift struggles with this afterlife, unable to decide if this is \u201ca heroic drama about poets rescuing a poet\u201d or \u201ca case study in psychiatry\u201d. Pound seems to have understood himself better than the experts. \u201cOfficially, I am as crazy as a coot,\u201d he told his daughter on his release in 1958, \u201cbut not a peril to society or myself.\u201d He died in 1972, aged 87.</p> <p><em>\u2022\u00a0The Bughouse\u00a0</em>by Daniel Swift is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a325).

          "body": "<p>Curiosity is one of the human animal\u2019s essential qualities, and two questions \u2013 where did we come from, and how did we get here? \u2013 continue to express the insatiable curiosity that animates human consciousness. Today, when we consider our place in the universe, the cosmos remains the supreme frontier of mankind\u2019s propensity to wonder at its origins.</p> <p>Last month, an event in a remote corner of our universe, another contemporary reminder of this timeless curiosity, hit the international headlines with the dramatic verification of a concept first predicted by Einstein in 1915: gravitational waves.</p> <p>In the words of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/sunday/finding-beauty-in-the-darkness.html?_r=0\"><em>New York Times</em></a><em>,</em> \u201ca minuscule jiggle, discovered in an exotic physics experiment\u201d saw two teams of American scientists, in collaboration with British and German partners, overcome almost insurmountable odds \u201cto open a vast new window on the cosmos\u201d. This, in simple language, was the wider significance of the moment \u2013 an astronomical \u201cfirst\u201d \u2013 when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo) announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/09/gravitational-waves-everything-you-need-to-know\">a signal from gravitational waves</a> had been discovered emanating from the collision and merger of two massive black holes (collapsed stars) more than a billion light years away.</p> <p>The mind-dizzying scale of this data only begins to come into focus when you remember that just one light year is approximately 5.88 trillion miles. Welcome to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/01/stephen-hawking-at-70\">Stephen Hawking</a> and his universe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He devoted the final chapters to 'wormholes', 'spiral galaxies' and, perhaps most controversial, 'superstring theory'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was, rather less distantly, in 1988 that Hawking confirmed his place as the most brilliant British scientist of his generation with the publication of <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, a succinct, entertaining and brilliantly lucid account of our relationship with the universe. In addition to his review of all the great theories of the cosmos, from Galileo and Newton to Einstein, Hawking, who was already renowned for his work on black holes, took the opportunity to explore and publicise some of the most speculative contemporary ideas about space and time. He devoted the final chapters of <em>A Brief History</em> to \u201cwormholes\u201d, \u201cspiral galaxies\u201d and, perhaps most controversial of all, \u201csuperstring theory\u201d, in a complex narrative that was also a sketch for Hawking\u2019s goal of a \u201ccomplete, consistent and unified\u201d theory of physics.</p> <p>It was his ambition, he wrote, to facilitate \u201cthe discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason \u2013 for then we would know the mind of God.\u201d</p> <p>What, you might ask, is the use of such hyperbole? What, indeed, is the justification for a highly theoretical department of science, such as astrophysics, that doesn\u2019t contribute to the improvement of the physical world (safer aeroplanes; faster cars; better washing machines)? Here we have to acknowledge the immense but intangible cultural significance of scientific inquiry, especially its ability to change mankind\u2019s perspective of its place in the universe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jan/01/stephen-hawking-at-70\">Stephen Hawking at 70: still the brightest star in the scientific universe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Who knows what the Ligo experiment or <em>A Brief History</em> will achieve? If history is any guide, however, the impact on our consciousness is potentially profound. Already, as my <em>Observer</em> colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/14/british-scientists-crucial-role-in-stronomical-breakthrough-gravitational-waves-einstein\">Robin McKie recently reported</a>: \u201cIt is now clear that astronomers have created a new type of astronomy: gravitational wave observation.\u201d The Ligo breakthrough joins an extraordinary tradition of scientific endeavour. As one of the scientists behind Ligo put it, \u201cThis confirms the existence of a range of intermediate black holes, about which we had theoretical doubts. Now those have gone. We\u2019re already going places.\u201d</p> <p>Over the centuries, Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Einstein and many others, often at great personal cost, have changed our understanding of the universe. Hawking\u2019s own boastful calculations of his book sales suggest that <em>A Brief History </em>will have influenced the minds of a generation as few other contemporary titles will have done. Translated into 40 languages, as he writes in the introduction to the latest paperback edition, <em>A Brief History</em> has sold \u201cabout one copy for every 750 man, woman and child in the world\u201d. Not bad for a book that, Hawking freely admits, he never expected \u201cto do anything like as well as it did\u201d.</p> <p>From its opening page, in which he repeats the apocryphal tale of the little old lady who told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/nov/18/bertrand-russell-philosopher-religion-ethics-life\">Bertrand Russell</a> that \u201cthe world is really a flat place supported on the back of a giant tortoise\u201d, Hawking\u2019s intention is to instruct and entertain. He recounts, tongue in cheek, that when Russell is said to have replied, with a smirk, \u201cWhat is the tortoise standing on?\u201d, the old lady answered, \u201cYou\u2019re very clever, young man, very clever. But it\u2019s turtles all the way down.\u201d Plainly, Hawking can appreciate the ironies implicit in the speculative side of quantum physics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, what follows is not fanciful but hard-nosed, an authoritative account, addressed to the layman, of Hawking\u2019s understanding of space and time, the expanding universe, particle physics and the origins of the universe. Nearly 30 years from publication, Hawking has refined some of his ideas. In 1988, he seems to have been tempted by quasi-spiritual distractions. In 2011, he spoke out unequivocally in favour of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/may/15/stephen-hawking-interview-there-is-no-heaven\">aetheistical understanding of man\u2019s origins</a>: \u201cWe are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.\u201d</p> <p>Hawking\u2019s own life and his heroic struggle with the debilitating effects of motor neurone disease have become braided into the world\u2019s response to <em>A Brief History</em> and many of his subsequent speculations, as if his suffering has somehow sharpened his perception of the cosmos and its mysteries. For the media, the oracular nature of his utterances, and the remarkable courage with which he has defied all predictions of his imminent mortality, have imbued some of his theories with a quasi-mystical status. The most cursory reading of <em>A Brief History of Time</em> will remind his readers that there is nothing fuzzy or untested about the intelligence behind this contemporary classic.</p> <h2>A signature line</h2> <p>\u201cOur goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.\u201d</p> <h2>Three to compare</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/isaac-newton\">Isaac Newton</a>: <em>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</em> (1687)<br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alberteinstein\">Albert Einstein</a>: \u201cOn the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\u201d (1905)<br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2014/aug/11/science-weekly-podcast-aristotle-armand-leroi-lagoon\">Aristotle</a>: <em>On the Heavens</em> (circa 340 BC)</p> <ul> <li><em>A Brief History Of Time by Stephen Hawking (Bantam, \u00a38.99).

If a binary system has a one or zero at opposite poles of a sphere, then a quantum one has values anywhere and everywhere. </p> <p>This makes a quantum system fast at calculating because it can test every possibility simultaneously; no waiting for one calculation after another. Interrupt it at any given time to collapse it at one of its states, and hey presto you have your answer. </p> <p>There is, of course, a caveat: you have to control the qubits and the subatomic particles in which they are stored.

A quantum computer will quickly decrypt data that would take billions of years today. You might think this bad from the security perspective, allowing criminals to decrypt every encrypted database. </p> <p>But quantum research is expensive, very expensive. So the \u201cgood guys\u201d, with the government budgets, will get the tech first, by a long margin. And when the bad guys do get all the gear, what quantum giveth it will soon taketh away again. While quantum computers will crack most any encryption, you\u2019ll know your data\u2019s been looked at, thanks to something called entanglement. Einstein called this <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/427174/einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-paradox-older-than-thought/\">\u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d</a> and spooky it may be, but it does provide us with perfect privacy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/dec/08/5g-cognitive-radio-future-connectivity-business\">Quantum key distribution</a> systems are already being developed that will know if they are being eavesdropped on and stop communicating until the spy goes away. </p> <h2>What will governments do with quantum?</h2> <p>Can quantum help governments wage war? Perhaps. The Ministry of Defence lab at Porton Down has been developing a device to measure tiny fluctuations in gravitational pull, which would act like <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/gravity-sensor-detector-see-through-walls-underground-ministry-of-defence-mod-bbc-horizon-project-a6947906.html\">super accurate radar</a>, with the capability to see through walls or deep underground. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists\">Relativity v quantum mechanics \u2013 the battle for the universe </a> </p> </aside>  <p>But some of the most exciting possibilities lie in the area of public health. Researchers at the University of Glasgow, working for one of the quantum technology hubs, established through \u00a3120m of UK investment, are hoping to revolutionise quantum imaging. Their projects include developing ultrasensitive cameras that can actually detect light down to a single photon. This has the potential to detect cancer without invasive medical imaging. </p> <p>And Australian researchers from the government-funded <a href=\"http://www.cqc2t.org/\">Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology</a> are taking the field of medical imaging into a whole new dimension. Rather than using magnets to create 3D images, the team\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12667\">nano-MRI project </a>uses the natural magnetic properties of the qubit to, in theory at least, allow imaging at the molecular level. If used to determine the structure of biomolecules such as proteins it could overcome many issues researchers face when developing new drugs.</p> <p>At the moment quantum computing is largely speculative and hugely expensive. It has staggering potential, but it remains to be seen whether governments\u2019 investments will pay off in the real world of public services. </p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",

It\u2019s a test of whether or not we hold fast to the values of non-discrimination and to universal values of freedom from persecution, so the stakes are very high,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n<p>Miliband said that \u201cthe allure, the glow, the magnetism\u201d of the west was being cast in doubt. Such influence depended, he said, on the principle that people were able to \u201chold their political views, practice their religion, lead their lives in ways that are not dominated by capricious discrimination\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThat allure remains strong. But when you meet families that are being torn apart by this ban, that causes doubt about what our countries stand for, and that is one of the most dangerous aspects of this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s executive order, signed last Friday, is focused in all but name at Muslims attempting to enter the US. It blocked all entry for 90 days for citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.</p> \n<p>The order also singled out refugees for harsh treatment, those deemed by the UN to have a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, political views or other factors. Trump banned entry of all refugees for the next four months, with Syria made subject to an indefinite refugee ban.</p> \n<p>In total, some 60,000 refugees who have already been granted security clearance to come to the US, are now in limbo as a result of the ban.</p> \n<p>The order has caused aftershocks across the Middle East and Europe, itself in the throes of its own refugee crisis. In the UK, the prime minister, Theresa May, has come under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/theresa-may-feels-heat-over-travel-ban-as-donald-trump-stands-firm\">fierce criticism</a> for cozying up to Trump, including holding his hand at the White House and inviting him to a state visit to the UK, while showing reluctance to criticize his immigration stance. </p> \n<p>Trump and May gave a joint press conference at the White House last Friday at which they heralded the renewed \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the US and UK. Moments after May left Washington, the US president unleashed his executive order. </p> \n<p>Miliband noted the confluence of events. He said it was a \u201cpity\u201d that the UK prime minister \u201cwasn\u2019t able to express the British position at the press conference with Donald Trump standing next to her\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe special relationship brings a special responsibility. Americans will notice clarity and conviction, and it\u2019s very important that it\u2019s expressed by America\u2019s closest allies.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added that he hoped the shock and outrage that had erupted across the US over Trump\u2019s immigration order would act as a wake-up call for Europe. \u201cThis should remind Europeans that what we now call European values of solidarity, compassion and internationalism were hard fought for. It should certainly be a reason for people in Britain to realize that Brexit is no excuse to abandon what we regard as civilized values.\u201d</p> \n<p>The IRC\u2019s work is likely to be affected on many levels by Trump\u2019s immigration ban. Founded in 1933 by Albert Einstein, himself a refugee to the US, the organization spans the full arc of the current crisis, from working on the ground in the countries covered by the order, including Iraq and Syria, as well as being one of the largest refugee resettlement groups in the US.</p> \n<p>The profile of the average refugee entering the US sharply contrasts with the ominous image of terrorist Trojan horses conjured up by Trump. Half of all refugees entering the country each year are children under the age of 14, and women make up a large portion of the remainder.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"36addf8b-64a0-4d1d-92fa-fe3f37d7e70c\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <figure class=\"element element-explainer element-atom\" data-display-type=\"flat\"> \n    <h1>US travel ban - a brief guide</h1> \n    <div>\n     <p>The executive order signed by Donald Trump suspends the entire US refugee admissions system,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">already one of the most rigorous in the world</a>, for 120 days.&nbsp;It also&nbsp;suspends the Syrian refugee program indefinitely, and&nbsp;bans entry to the US to people from seven majority-Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 for 90 days. The order has prompted a series of legal challenges, while thousands of Americans have protested outside airports and courthouses in solidarity with Muslims and migrants.</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A paradox of Trump\u2019s pledge to introduce \u201cextreme vetting\u201d is that refugees are already subjected to more extreme vetting by the US than any other group. They have to jump through numerous hoops in the course of an intense review that can last up to three years, including biometric testing, face-to-face interviews and background checks by the FBI, CIA and other intelligence and security agencies.</p> \n<p>By specifically targeting Muslims, Trump was playing with fire, Miliband said: \u201cThis policy is a propaganda gift to extremists around the world who want to tell Muslim communities that America doesn\u2019t want them and doesn\u2019t want to help them. That is a real and present danger to global stability.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his travels through the US in recent months, Miliband said he had met a number of individuals who underlined the positive contributions made by refugees. He recalled the baklava baker from Damascus whose house was bombed in 2012 and who recently relocated to America, and the Iranian Christian who fled religious persecution.</p> \n<p>Such encounters had taught him \u201cthe wisdom of the terrible quote from Stalin that a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths a statistic. I think there\u2019s a grave danger in the refugee crisis that the scale of the numbers desensitizes people. The first thing is to remember the human scale: what we are trying to do is make the world better one life at the time\u201d.</p> \n<p>Miliband noted that working as he does in the IRC\u2019s Manhattan offices he often glimpses the Statue of Liberty in the distance, causing him to reflect on the famous poem on its base: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d </p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always known that America had its political divisions, but there has never been a notion of two Americas when it comes to the idea of providing a haven to refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shocking thought that America could divide on the very idea of its foundation.\u201d</p>",

Real experiments arbitrate eventually, of course, but thought experiments have a long and productive history of pointing the way to deeper understanding. <br /></p> <p>Probably the master of them was Einstein. He imagined trying to catch up with a ray of light, and decided the idea was absurd. This influenced his development of his theories of relativity, in which it is impossible to catch up with light, because it travels at the same speed for everyone. The theory led to predictions that are, arguably, equally absurd. Time flows at different rates depending on relative speed, for example. But those predictions have been thoroughly vindicated by real experiments. <br /></p> <p>Thought experiments including relativitistic pole-vaulters running into garages, spacefareing twins, or train guards with flashlights are still important in teaching relativity and testing how thoroughly you and your students have (mis)understood it.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2014/nov/22/sizing-up-a-new-particle-accelerator-and-the-cosmic-stupid-limit\">Sizing up a new particle accelerator, and the 'cosmic stupid' limit | Jon Butterworth | Life&amp;Physics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Einstein bowled a series of thought experiments at the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr in the first half of the 20th Century, in an attempt to defeat quantum indeterminism. In this case, Bohr\u2019s straight bat was firm enough to reply, and he finished the innings \u2018not out\u2019. The result was a better understanding of physics all round, however.<br /></p> <p>Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, also used thought experiments. As far as we know, no cats were harmed in his famous attempt to highlight the apparent contradictions of the so-called \u2018Copenhagen Interpretation\u2019 of the new theory. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat lives on as a useful idea however, still relevant as physicists build larger and larger coherent quantum systems, in attempts to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and also to make use of them in practical applications such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/22/age-of-quantum-computing-d-wave\">computing</a>.</p> <p>One of the biggest open questions in physics is how gravity and quantum mechanics might come together to give a single consistent description of nature. We may be lucky and get clues about this from real experiments, but much of the exploration of the boundaries between these two giants of physics has to take place at such extreme energies that thought experiments are the only way forward for now. The quantum emission of radiation near the event horizon of a black hole is a good example, famously theorized by Stephen Hawking.</p> <p>The bit about \u2018contrived extremes\u2019 lends itself to certain political analogies, especially in the UK and the USA at present, but I am not going to go there. An important aspect of thought experiments is that they are cheap and safe. In thought, we can travel to the event horizon of a black hole without being spaghettified. We can ponder quantum coherence without harming any cats, and try to overtake a light ray without leaving our armchair. We can check the rules of the game for consistency without having to watch every ball until one heads for the stumps, grazes the bowler\u2019s fingers and loops into the air.<br /></p> <p>And on that last point, to resolve the suspense cunningly introduced at the start of the article:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The catch takes precedence over the run-out, so the striker is out.

But, like many women who suffer from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder\" title=\"\">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),</a> she did not fit the stereotypical profile of a child with the condition. Beckett\u2019s difficulties would come later in life, when she failed to live up to her academic potential, experienced two failed marriages and had mental health\u00a0problems.</p> <p>At 36, Beckett decided to seek help. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neuroscience\" title=\"\">neuroscientist</a> in York told her that the results of an EEG\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0recording of brain activity\u00a0\u2013 suggested she had ADHD. \u201cI\u00a0dismissed his diagnosis as rubbish,\u201d she says. \u201cHow could I\u00a0have ADHD? I\u00a0was just [being] crap and needed to sort myself\u00a0out.\u201d</p> <p>Beckett\u2019s problems escalated from there. She experienced mood swings so dramatic that any criticism could cause her to go from feeling happy to contemplating suicide. After a\u00a0failed business venture, she ended up in the care of a\u00a0local mental health crisis\u00a0team, believing that her \u201cfamily and the world would be far better off without\u00a0me\u201d.</p> <p>It was then that ADHD was mentioned again by a\u00a0psychiatrist, and, at the age of 44, she decided to seek a\u00a0private diagnosis; one that not only transformed her life but saved it: \u201cEverything fell into place. I\u00a0wasn\u2019t crap because I\u00a0found VAT returns painful,\u00a0blurted out stuff and\u00a0was messy. I\u00a0wasn\u2019t crap at all. I\u00a0have a\u00a0neuro difference, which gives me many advantages.\u201d Beckett is just one of many people who slipped through the diagnostic net as children and were left to cope with their ADHD into\u00a0adulthood.</p> <p>It\u2019s now <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3000907/\" title=\"\">30 years</a> since the American Psychiatric Association agreed that ADHD was the best term to describe this\u00a0condition. It has long been viewed as something that predominantly affects children\u00a0\u2013 mostly young boys\u00a0\u2013 but increasing numbers of adults are now being diagnosed. According to the <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/adhdinadults.aspx\" title=\"\">Royal College of Psychiatrists,</a> ADHD is indeed more common in boys than in girls \u2013 surveys of children between the ages of five and 15 years have found that 3.62% of boys and 0.85% of girls had ADHD. As many people get older, however, the condition improves and around 1% of adults continue to have the condition, with about 2-4% showing partial\u00a0symptoms.</p> <p>ADHD in adults has come under the spotlight this year with new advances in clinical research. A BBC Horizon programme featured comedian Rory Bremner\u2019s personal journey to understand the science behind the condition. And the thinktank Demos has started a\u00a0research project exploring the social and financial impact of undiagnosed ADHD in adults. It is due to be completed this\u00a0year.</p> <p>Even though ADHD is viewed as a\u00a0modern condition, it was being discussed as early as the <a href=\"http://adhdhistory.com/sir-george-f-still/\" title=\"\">Edwardian\u00a0period, probably as a result of the </a>advent of compulsory schooling in\u00a0Britain.</p> <p>I\u00a0was diagnosed with ADHD when I\u00a0was six. I\u00a0doubt my psychiatrist felt much ambivalence when he was diagnosing me. During one of the assessments, instead of focusing on arranging a\u00a0series of pictures into chronological order, I\u00a0thought it would be more productive to climb to the top of the bookshelves in his office. I\u00a0was easy to diagnose, but many children with ADHD aren\u2019t bouncing off the walls or scaling bookshelves and are therefore much less likely to receive a\u00a0diagnosis in childhood. This is especially true for women, whose ADHD tends to manifest in less overt ways than it does in\u00a0boys.</p> <p>Dr Ashok\u00a0Roy, head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 intellectual disability\u00a0faculty, says the core symptoms are the same in men and women, but that \u201cfemale patients\u2019 inattention problems often are combined with daydreaming, whereas men have more hyperactivity and behavioural problems, which are more noticeable during\u00a0childhood\u201d. Roy has also observed that women with ADHD also tend to suffer from other disorders that can affect their mood and\u00a0behaviour.</p> <p>Arielle, a 27-year-old writer from Boston, was diagnosed with ADHD when she was\u00a019. She remembers always being a\u00a0quiet child: \u201cI\u00a0didn\u2019t show the classic signs people think of when they hear about hyperactivity. Instead of bouncing off the walls, I\u00a0simply fidget constantly. I\u00a0slept through most of school, but, if I\u00a0was awake, I\u00a0never was an attentive listener,\u201d she\u00a0says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Over the years, I started to assume I was just lazy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Arielle says her grades suffered throughout school because she was unable to focus on her homework. Her teachers told her that if she just did her homework, stayed awake in class and became organised, she could be a\u00a0straight-A student. \u201cOver the years, I\u00a0started to assume I\u00a0was just lazy. Instead of thinking there might be something wrong biologically, I\u00a0assumed it was all my fault. And, every time I\u2019d resolve to be better at being attentive in class, or neat or diligent about homework, I\u2019d inevitably\u00a0fail.\u201d</p> <p>Arielle feels that going undiagnosed until adulthood was \u201cpretty harmful\u201d for her, and sometimes tells herself that if she really had ADHD, someone would have noticed it sooner: \u201cI\u00a0still frequently doubt that I\u00a0have ADHD and sometimes believe I\u2019m just fooling everyone in an attempt to excuse my forgetfulness, messy nature, issues with planning ahead and problems completing\u00a0projects.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not surprising that Arielle feels this way, as there is a\u00a0prevailing scepticism about the condition, even among psychiatrists. The most frequent criticism levelled at the diagnosis of ADHD is that it pathologises normal behaviours. The neurologist Dr Richard Saul promoted this idea in his 2014 book, ADHD Does Not Exist. At the same time, in <a href=\"http://time.com/25370/doctor-adhd-does-not-exist/\" title=\"\">an article for Time magazine</a>, Saul expressed concern over the stimulants used to treat ADHD\u00a0\u2013 most commonly methylphenidate\u00a0\u2013 and argued that, under the criteria employed to diagnose the condition, \u201cthe entire US population could potentially qualify. We have all had these moments and, in moderate amounts, they\u2019re a\u00a0normal part of the human\u00a0condition.\u201d</p> <p>These arguments tend to come as a\u00a0reaction to the recent explosion of ADHD diagnoses in children, particularly in the US. However, Roy argues that \u201cuntreated populations fare worse on academic, social and occupational outcomes as well as contact with the law\u201d. He argues that practitioners should \u201cguard against overdiagnosis by the use of systematic assessments using internationally agreed\u00a0criteria\u201d.</p> <p>In April this year, <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(17)30049-4/fulltext\" title=\"\">the Lancet </a>published a\u00a0report that suggests the condition is a\u00a0valid pathology. Researchers from nine countries scanned the brains of people aged between four and 63 years old, 1,713 with ADHD and 1,529 without. The report found small differences in brain size between those with the condition and those without it. These differences were more pronounced in children, and the differences were still apparent in unmedicated\u00a0subjects.</p> <p>If we accept that ADHD is real, then we might want to address the lack of awareness that exists within our society, as undiagnosed adults are often left to live dysfunctional lives. According to Roy, part of the problem when diagnosing adults is that they are more likely to \u201cinternalise their inner restlessness rather than act it out as children\u00a0do\u201d. Roy adds: \u201cThis may manifest as mood swings, difficulty getting along with others, problems holding down a\u00a0job, substance-abuse problems, and a\u00a0pattern of being irresponsible and making poor decisions. These behaviours may be incorrectly attributed to personality problems, anxiety or depression rather than\u00a0ADHD.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d41aa2d621c610505699ceb0ddc2338bd66c277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d41aa2d621c610505699ceb0ddc2338bd66c277/0_424_4122_5153/800.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Jones \u2026 \u2018It has been a revelation to understand it.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Jones \u2026 \u2018It has been a revelation to understand it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, the most common story I hear from those I speak to with ADHD is that they were diagnosed with conditions such as depression and anxiety before they discovered they had it. This is something I\u00a0can attest to. I\u00a0stopped receiving treatment for ADHD in my teens. This was partly because I\u00a0moved around so much but also because I\u00a0was resistant to the label; I\u00a0didn\u2019t want to believe there was something wrong with me. In my early 20s, I\u00a0sought treatment again only because my life was falling apart. I\u00a0didn\u2019t receive the support I\u00a0felt I\u00a0needed and was given antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication instead.</p> <p>Victoria Jones is a\u00a0very amiable student from Lancashire who begins talking to me a\u00a0mile a\u00a0minute in a\u00a0way that would defeat the deftest shorthand practitioner. Like many people with undiagnosed\u00a0ADHD, she had been treated for anxiety and depression for 10 years prior to her diagnosis. Before being diagnosed, Jones led a\u00a0chaotic life, experienced many failed relationships, flitted from one job to the other, and eventually ended up owing \u00a325,000 through impulse spending and her inability to manage her debts.</p> <p>Since being diagnosed with ADHD at age 34, she has been on \u201ca\u00a0rollercoaster\u201d of emotions and\u00a0learning: \u201cHaving been one of those people who thought it was an excuse for boys\u2019 \u2018naughty\u2019 behaviour, it has been a\u00a0revelation to learn about and understand\u00a0it.\u201d She is involved in an ADHD support group in Lancashire and wants to raise awareness about the condition: \u201cI\u00a0wish more than anything that the media, schools and other agencies were educated better on the topic and it became as understood and supported as autism. I\u00a0think this would give families, friends and the rest of society the means to assist in and improve the lives of those who have\u00a0it.\u201d</p> <p>John, 30, from the home\u00a0counties, says he has struggled with insomnia since childhood and has experienced problems in his personal and professional life due to his forgetfulness: \u201cMy relationships always suffer\u00a0\u2013 I\u00a0have lost count of the number of friends from my teens and early 20s I\u00a0no longer speak to due to being useless at keeping in touch, forgetting to respond to messages or simply not remembering that they exist.\u201d John adds that this applies to everything in his life: \u201cIf it\u2019s beyond my very narrow, immediate focus, it gets ignored, even consciously put to one side. I\u00a0will step over piles of urgent laundry to complete my pointless DIY project. I\u00a0will pay late fees on bills I\u00a0can easily afford just because it seems that paying them will take me several hours, and I\u00a0really want to do something\u00a0else.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I will step over piles of urgent laundry to complete my pointless DIY project</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>John was finally diagnosed quite recently and, like many adults with ADHD, he became aware of the condition through his own\u00a0research. He was assessed and diagnosed relatively quickly, but has mixed feelings about the treatment he has received: \u201cI\u2019ve been on methylphenidate since being diagnosed a\u00a0few months ago. Initially, I\u00a0thought it was a\u00a0gamechanger\u00a0\u2013 I\u00a0could sit down and complete something without getting distracted.\u201d But more recently John has begun to have doubts: \u201cI\u00a0notice I\u00a0can be a\u00a0little too focused, energetic and positive, and if I am doing something pointless when my meds kick in, that can be a\u00a0whole day\u00a0wasted.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Kavanagh, 44, an animator from Dublin, didn\u2019t receive a\u00a0diagnosis until he was 43. \u201cI\u00a0often wondered why I\u00a0had so many challenges in achieving what others found relatively easy to do,\u201d he says. He only suspected he might have the condition when he met the neuroscientist \u00c1ine Behan, who, as CEO of Cortechs, was developing gaming technology to help children with ADHD improve their focus. \u201cI\u00a0knew little about the condition at the time, but as my research into the area deepened, I\u00a0recognised many of my own traits in the symptoms attributed to ADHD\u00a0sufferers.\u201d</p> <p>Kavanagh describes himself as fidgety, often impatient, a\u00a0poor sleeper and someone who struggles to complete tasks. \u201cI\u00a0often feel like when I\u00a0start something, I should be able to do it immediately rather than having to go through a\u00a0learning process. I\u2019ve always been impatient for results and often start a\u00a0lot of different things and quickly become\u00a0overwhelmed.\u201d</p> <p>Roy says that many adults remain undiagnosed because psychiatrists do not receive enough\u00a0training. He believes the government needs to invest more in this. Labour\u2019s shadow minister for mental health, Barbara Keeley, agrees. \u201cAdults with ADHD who are undiagnosed and untreated in childhood are at greater risk of low self-esteem, substance abuse, anxiety and depression,\u201d she says. \u201cInvesting in children\u2019s mental health services and in early intervention is key to preventing this spiral.\u201d She adds that it is \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d that Health Education England is cutting back on training courses for GPs and\u00a0trainees.</p> <p>The Department of Health describes Keeley\u2019s comments as \u201ccompletely misleading\u201d and adds that since 2005 the government has made an additional \u00a3250m available each year for children\u2019s mental health services, and that by the end of 2017 it intends to publish a\u00a0green paper setting out plans to improve access and the provision of\u00a0services.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear if ADHD should be considered an\u00a0illness. It really describes a\u00a0different type of\u00a0brain, and may be partially responsible for the achievements of many successful people, including Albert Einstein and Katherine Ellison. Despite the serious problems that adults with undiagnosed ADHD face, many living with the condition say it has had a\u00a0positive impact on their lives\u00a0too. As well as being inattentive, their ADHD allows them to hyper-focus, and their impulsivity can inspire\u00a0creativity.</p> <p>Beckett says she wouldn\u2019t change her ADHD. \u201cI\u00a0can be quick-thinking, creative, adaptable, warm, enthusiastic, authentic, honest, spontaneous, ambitious, driven to change the world, feisty and outspoken. I am interested in many different types of people, many different issues and many concepts and ideas. I\u00a0strongly believe I\u00a0wouldn\u2019t have these traits if I\u00a0didn\u2019t have\u00a0ADHD.\u201d</p> <p>Kavanagh has a\u00a0similar outlook and likens ADHD to a \u201cclockwork toy wound up and set loose in a\u00a0labyrinth without a\u00a0map. You run in to a\u00a0lot of walls, but occasionally you break through some of\u00a0them.\u201d He, too, says he wouldn\u2019t change his condition: \u201cDespite all the hard knocks I have encountered getting to where I\u00a0am, I\u00a0wouldn\u2019t trade ADHD for anything. It\u2019s part of what makes me who I\u00a0am, and I\u00a0embrace\u00a0that.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.

          "body": "<p>Last November, the Guardian environment columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mckibben-bill\">Bill McKibben </a> made the grim prediction that the \u201cdamage from the US election would be measured in geologic time\u201d.</p> <p>One hundred days and counting into Trump\u2019s presidency, there\u2019s little reason for optimism. The former CEO Of ExxonMobil is our secretary of state. The new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency wants to dismantle the agency. The Keystone pipeline has been revived, the clean power plan is in peril, and vast swaths of the Atlantic seaboard may be opened to offshore drilling.</p> <p>At this critical moment, the Guardian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/mar/30/guardian-bolsters-award-winning-environment-team\">expanded its environment desk</a>, adding three heavyweight reporters to its continent-spanning, award-winning team to bolster our coverage in the US and around the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe environment barely exists as a political issue in many developed countries, and there are climate change deniers in the White House,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote in a recent email to staff announcing the appointments. \u201cThere has never been a greater need for serious and innovative environmental journalism.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, we\u2019ll continue to aggressively cover the Trump administration\u2019s ties to the fossil fuel industry and attacks on science. We\u2019ll tackle issues of environmental justice, and the impact of climate change and pollution on the nation\u2019s most vulnerable communities. Just today we launched <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/02/keystone-xl-pipeline-route-water-native-american-reserves\">Life on the Keystone XL</a>, a three-part series documenting our reporter\u2019s 1,700-mile journey along the proposed pipeline route to meet the people and communities who will be affected should the construction go ahead.</p> <p>We\u2019ll also explore solutions and opportunities to the climate change crisis, such as innovative technology, renewable energy and green growth.</p> <p>As part of the new appointments, the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Watts will take up the role of global environment editor in a few months\u2019 time. Below, he shares his thoughts on why, after 21 years reporting for the Guardian from Tokyo, Beijing and Rio de Janeiro, he believes this is the most important story on the planet right now.<br /></p> <p><em>Support the Guardian\u2019</em><em>s in-depth and investigative reporting on cli</em><em>mate change and environment <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_memco_jsclimate_copy\">by becoming a member</a> or <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_memco_jsclimate_copy\">making a contribution today</a>.</em></p> <h2><strong>A message from Jonathan Watts, the Guardian\u2019s newly appointed global environment editor</strong></h2> <p>The environment has always been a subject close to my heart and it has become an increasing focus of my work over two decades with the Guardian. That is no doubt because the problems of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and over-consumption have become bigger and more apparent.<br /></p> <p>When I started out as a cub reporter in Japan in the mid-1990s, I learned a lot collaborating with Paul Brown, then the environment correspondent, on articles about the Tokaimura nuclear accident and Kyoto climate protocol. After moving to China in 2003, I increasingly found myself writing about smog, cancer villages, species extinction and carbon emissions. The ramping up of environmental stories was not a deliberate strategy. China\u2019s crisis was so bad that it was impossible to ignore. This made for grim news, but it also made me hopeful that it might be a fulcrum for change. </p> <p>After the Olympics in 2008, I switched jobs to become Asia environment correspondent. In this post, I covered the Copenhagen Climate Conference with John Vidal and Suzanne Goldenberg; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/oct/25/nagoya-biodiversity-summit\">Nagoya biodiversity conference</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/03/fukushima-fears-nuclear-angle-japan-suffering\">Fukushima tsunami and nuclear disaster</a>; and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/19/china-windfarms-renewable-energy\">rapid growth of wind</a> and solar power in the deserts of China. For the past five years, I have been the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, writing on a broader range of subjects but still putting a priority on environment and development, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/27/amazon-deforestation-report-brazil-paris-climate-talks\">Amazon deforestation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/honduras-berta-caceres-murder-enivronment-activist-human-rights\">killings of conservation activists</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/09/amazon-tribe-protecting-forest-bows-arrows-gps-camera-traps\">role of indigenous communities in forest protection</a> and the disturbing frequency of forest fires, floods and other extreme weather events.</p> <p>So why am I going back into full-time, specialised environmental reporting? Because it is the most important story of our age. China led me to suspect that global economic growth had run into an ecological wall, which is the underlying source of stress and conflict in the world. When I moved to Latin America, I hoped to find alternative, less destructive paths of development, but there was a part of me that also felt I was running away from my own conclusions. The new post will take me back.</p> <p>The responsibility is huge. The timing is crucial. The Brexit referendum was a vote against globalisation. Trump is waging war on the environment. To counter these trends, the Guardian has devoted more resources to its environment coverage. I am looking forward to being a part of an expanded team, but we have a tough act to follow. Brown, Vidal, George Monbiot, Damian Carrington and other present and former colleagues have been pioneers in this field with agenda-setting coverage and comment. Trying to maintain that quality, ambition and influence \u2013 while looking for new approaches to changing situations \u2013 will be a hard but worthwhile task.<br /></p> <p>As to the task that humanity faces, I think the problem and the solution are environmental. The world\u2019s current concerns \u2013 rising nationalism, swelling migration, financial instability, worsening inequality and lack of confidence in governance systems \u2013 are to varying degrees caused by insecurity and fear about the future. Underlying that is an awareness (conscious or unconscious) that our current path of capital- and carbon-driven development is wrecking our home planet, running down resources, devastating other species and building up environmental costs that are increasingly difficult to offload on distant countries and coming generations. We have to pay a bill that has been run up over centuries and it feels as if we are broke. But that is misleading. There is still plenty left if we manage it well and share it more fairly.</p> <p>We need to reconsider what is important, what is worth paying for and how decisions are being made. At a national level, why are we devoting so much public money to subsidise fossil fuels that are destroying the climate? Why are most politics determined by four-, five- or six-year electoral cycles that suit the markets but not the long-term interests of voters? Why do our economic systems make it cheaper to dump plastic in the oceans than recycle? Why do the traditional beliefs of some countries encourage the slaughter of endangered animals or denial of climate science? Why are forests worth less than cropland? Why do we continue to prioritise material growth when it increasingly leads to obesity, cancer, conflict and instability?</p> <p>The key, I think, is to realise that, contrary to what Bill Clinton\u2019s election strategist once maintained, it\u2019s not \u201cthe economy, stupid!\u201d \u2013 it is in fact the environment that is shaping everything. Which is to say that we must put our home in order before we can consider anything else. That is tough. Currently, political systems are skewed against the environment and the subject is hidden away in a media ghetto. It is a depressing page on a news website or an unpopular slot on TV channels. Most of us would prefer to pretend it didn\u2019t exist. Yet, for me the environment is not a subject, it is the prism through which everything else must be seen. It is the basis for the economy, for science, for society, for politics. Adam Smith, Albert Einstein, Karl Marx and Mao Zedong never understood this. Nor did the founders of the great religions. They didn\u2019t need to. They did not live in the Anthropocene.</p> <p>So, how to put the environment front and centre is the big challenge. Following my predecessors, I will continue to visit the frontline of humankind\u2019s impact on the natural world \u2013 the oceans, forests, mountains, deserts, poles, science labs, conference halls and affected communities \u2013 where I will continue to bear witness and record testimonies of change. But they are just symptoms. I hope I can also work with and encourage my colleagues on other news desks to consider the environment in their coverage of politics, social change, economics, psychology, art, religion and education. Those areas, close to home, perhaps inside our heads, are where we will find the cause and the cure. It\u2019s time to colonise the colonisers.</p> <p>We are all entering disconcerting new territory. Given demographic, economic and consumerist trends, the next 30 years will be difficult. But there is more than enough new knowledge and technology, as well as old philosophy and religion, to make things much better. It is all about choices and action.</p> <p>\u2013 Jonathan Watts, incoming global environment editor for the Guardian </p> <p><em>Support the Guardian\u2019s </em><em>in-depth and investigative reporting on </em><em>climate change and environment <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/supporter?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_memco_jsclimate_footer\">by becoming a member</a> or <a href=\"https://contribute.theguardian.com?INTCMP=gdnwb_copts_editorial_memco_jsclimate_footer\">making a contribution today</a>.</em></p>",

          "body": "<p>A fortune teller once warned Zhou Youguang he would not live past 35. The prediction was plausible, as Zhou himself later noted. Average life expectancy in China was then around 30. He had experienced tuberculosis and depression and within a few years would narrowly escape death in a Japanese bombing raid that killed the man beside him. Yet his eventual death came the day after his 111th birthday.</p> <p>By then he had fewer than 50 peers worldwide. The rest are known primarily for their survival, and Zhou had a variety of explanations for his own longevity: modern medicine, eating when hungry and sleeping when tired, and simply the fact that \u201cGod has forgotten me\u201d, a remark reflecting both his humility and his humour. But he had staked his claim to a place in the history books more than half a century before, as \u201cthe father of pinyin\u201d, having established what became the international standard for romanisation of Chinese.</p> <p>It is thanks to pinyin that we now read about Beijing, not Peking. The system helped literacy rates in China to rocket: <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Do-Chinese-people-read-write-understand-pinyin\" title=\"\">children learn pinyin</a> as a stepping stone to characters because \u2013 unlike these \u2013 it corresponds to the sound of words. It also became \u201ca bridge to speech between Chinese people\u201d, Zhou pointed out, helping Putonghua, or standard Chinese, to spread.</p> <p>\u201cBefore, I met a Cantonese and a Hokkien in foreign countries and couldn\u2019t communicate \u2013 I had to speak English to them. Without an alphabet you had to learn mouth to mouth, ear to ear,\u201d he told me when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/21/china\" title=\"\">I interviewed him</a> at his modest third-floor apartment in Beijing in 2008. He was a mere 102 then: fascinating, wry, delightful company and unnecessarily apologetic for the rustiness of his (fluent) English.</p> <p>He was born Zhou Yaoping \u2013 he adopted the pen name \u201cYouguang\u201d because he wanted to \u201cbring light\u201d into the world \u2013 to an official\u2019s family in Changzhou, eastern China. The Qing dynasty still ruled. But within five years, China would collapse into turmoil: Zhou would live through warlordism, the rise of the Kuomintang, foreign occupation, civil war, the communist revolution and all that followed.</p> <p>He studied at St John\u2019s University and then Guanghua University in Shanghai, graduating with a degree in economics; he had minored in linguistics. A fellow student was Zhang Yunhe, one of four famously accomplished sisters, whom he married in 1933. After the Japanese invasion they fled to the wartime capital, Chongqing, where their young daughter died of appendicitis because they could not reach the hospital in time.</p> <p>Yet even then he maintained hope. \u201cWhen you encounter difficulties, you need to be optimistic ... The pessimists tend to die,\u201d he told the AFP news agency.</p> <p>In 1946, he moved to New York, where he worked for a Chinese bank on Wall Street and met Albert Einstein via friends at Princeton. But when the communists took power in China three years later, Zhou rejected offers from American banks and chose to return, like so many idealistic intellectuals who hoped to build a new and better China. He became an economics professor in Shanghai.</p> <p>Soon afterwards came his greatest piece of luck. Zhou Enlai, the country\u2019s premier, had met him in Chongqing and now wanted him to oversee a reform of the written language. Zhou Youguang, who regarded his studies of language and linguistics as a hobby, allowed himself to be persuaded, and pinyin was launched in 1958. That shielded him from the worst when Mao Zedong unleashed the vicious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rightist_Movement\" title=\"\">anti-rightist campaign</a> a few years later and economist friends were persecuted; several killed themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da8e9a92591bd847b3b62c2d41d0cf34b95edbdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da8e9a92591bd847b3b62c2d41d0cf34b95edbdc/0_25_569_341/500.jpg\" alt=\"Zhou Youguang and Zhang Yunhe on their wedding day, 30 April 1933.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhou Youguang and Zhang Yunhe on their wedding day, 30 April 1933.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Paper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/24/cultural-revolution-portraits-xu-weixin\" title=\"\">Cultural Revolution</a> broke out in 1966, Zhou was exiled to a labour camp in the countryside. In later life he chuckled with friends about his overqualification for the role to which he had been assigned: the former banker and father of pinyin had been set to work scaring birds away from crops.</p> <p>Following his rehabilitation, he oversaw the translation of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, earning himself the nickname Encyclopaedia Zhou. Officially he retired at 85, but at home he averaged an essay a month. The best tonic was remaining curious and continuing to learn, he said. His embrace of new ideas included helping Sharp to design the first practical electronic Chinese typewriter.

          "body": "<p>Mo Gawdat is the chief business officer at Google X \u2013 the \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d responsible for some of the company\u2019s more audacious projects, such as self-driving cars and a balloon-powered global internet. Before he joined Google, while working as stock trader and tech executive in Dubai and in response to a period of depression, he used his engineer\u2019s mindset to create an \u201cequation for happiness\u201d. The equation says that happiness is greater than, or equal to, your perception of the events in your life minus your expectation of how life should be.</p> <p>When his 21-year-old son Ali died during a routine operation, Gawdat turned to the equation, which they had worked on together, in an attempt to come to terms with his tragic loss. Gawdat\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/solve-for-happy.html\"><em>Solve for Happy</em></a>, explains the theories underpinning the equation and how it helped him sustain his life after Ali\u2019s death.</p> <p><strong>To an outsider you were a successful, wealthy individual with a loving family; not an obvious candidate for someone who felt the need to devote themselves to developing a theory of happiness. You say the more money you had, the less happy you became. </strong><br />That is correct and it\u2019s not uncommon among many of my successful and wealthy friends. The scientific research will tell you that the more income you get the more happy you will become, but once you get to average income your happiness plateaus. Moreover, I found that when you go even higher, wealth starts to work against you \u2013 people start to treat you differently; you start to feel a constant disappointment.</p> <p><strong>You mention that while you were on the \u201chedonistic treadmill\u201d you bought two Rolls-Royces online on a whim.</strong><br />That truly was a turning point. This was again the attempt to fill that gap in my soul. When they arrived I was completely disappointed, they were pretty, I sat in them for 20 minutes but then I went back to my unhappy thoughts, and once you go back to the things that make you unhappy it doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s parked in the garage. That was a turning point, that nothing material will solve this stuff.</p> <p><strong>Do you still have them?</strong><br />I\u2019ve been trying to sell them, I\u2019ve tried giving them to charity. They are in showrooms waiting to be sold. I rent cars now.</p> <p><strong>You weren\u2019t able to find joy in your life. Is finding joy a skill that should be taught?</strong><br />Absolutely. Happiness is very much like staying fit. You start with the decision that you are going to get fit, you find out how \u2013 but knowing that is not enough, you have to go to the gym to work out and eat healthily. To me the whole topic of happiness is exactly the same. First you understand that happiness is a choice, that you can actually achieve it and that there is a method to make it happen. Happiness is not a coincidence, it is not given to you by life, it\u2019s entirely our responsibility.</p> <p><strong>When your son died, did you feel like jettisoning your theories? Are you surprised that your equation held up in such tragic circumstances?</strong><br />You know how there are five stages of grief? We started with acceptance. My wife at the time made an insightful comment when they asked to do an autopsy on Ali\u2019s body: \u201cWill it bring Ali back?\u201d The realisation that nothing we could do, including crying in our rooms for the next 17 years, would ever bring him back\u2026 we started from there.</p> <p>I then went through a rollercoaster. But I would sometimes imagine talking to Ali and if you knew him, his first reaction would be: \u201cPapa I\u2019ve already died, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, so what are you going to make out of it?\u201d When I started going through this dialogue it made me realise that this can be for a reason, for good can come out of it.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever wonder how you would have responded to your son\u2019s death if you hadn\u2019t developed your happiness equation?</strong><br />I would have definitely left life, I wouldn\u2019t have killed myself, but I would have found a corner somewhere and shut the door and sat there until they came. Ali was not just my son, he was my mentor, best friend, confidante, my teacher, he truly was \u201cit\u201d, basically. I can\u2019t imagine I would have handled it at all without the model we built together.</p> <p><strong>You talk about how happiness is a human\u2019s default state. Where\u2019s your evidence for this?</strong><br />That was one of the eye-openers for me. The first observation was I was a very happy young man until around 25, and then something went wrong, and I became very unhappy. To me, an engineer, that means you have a highly optimised machine that began to misbehave. So I started to go back to all the points where I was happy. If you go back to childhood, you observe that if a child\u2019s basic needs are met their default state is happy \u2013 they don\u2019t need an iPhone, they can play with their toes and be happy.</p> <p><strong>You say that the voice inside your head isn\u2019t you. If we aren\u2019t the voices inside our heads, what are we?</strong><br />We have a set of illusions. One of them is that we associate so strongly with the voice in our head when the reality is that it is just a biological function; it is exactly like your heart pumping blood around your body. It\u2019s your brain\u2019s way of delivering survival functions to you \u2013 its job is to scan the world around it using sensory input and then coordinate your muscle responses and take action so that you survive.</p> <p>Thoughts have truly propelled our civilisation, and we think of the voice inside our heads as us. But that isn\u2019t remotely true once you realise that you don\u2019t have to obey your thoughts \u2013 I can accept them, I can reject them, I can ask the brain to go and get me a better one. You can do what people do in meetings: you ask me a question, I give you an answer, but you can say to me: \u201cMo, can you get me a better answer?\u201d, and I go back to my brain and I say, give me a better answer. Treat your brain as a biological function and understand he is not the boss \u2013 you are the boss.</p> <p><strong>Can you explain what you mean by the illusion of time?</strong><br />We deal with time every day, yet no one really knows what time is, including the master of the science of time Albert Einstein. He\u2019ll tell you that past, present and future is nothing more than a stubborn persistent illusion. We have created machines that measure mechanical movement in such a way, yet we have no idea what it is that we are measuring and we are very happy to torture ourselves with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/12/googles-research-sibling-x-shuts-down-drones-project\">Google's research sibling X shuts down drones project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you ask a Buddhist what time it is, their answer will be \u201cthe time is now\u201d. Like a Buddhist, the only time you have ever lived is a moment of now. You\u2019ve never lived in the past, you will never live in the future; when the future comes it will be a moment of now. Yet we never give ourselves the luxury of living in now; instead, we are constantly living inside our heads looking in the past and the future, and as you do that you constantly suffer.</p> <p><strong>Could you turn your equation into an app?</strong><br />Absolutely. I believe that the book is just the start of a very big initiative. I am trying to create a movement that doesn\u2019t depend on me or the book. I\u2019ve set myself a target of 10 million people happy, and I\u2019m hoping that everyone will set themselves a target of 25 people or 25 million happy, depending on their reach. I\u2019m not about selling books, I believe I\u2019ve been paid by life already.</p> <p><strong>In what sense was your quest to develop an equation for happiness informed by Google X\u2019s moonshot philosophy, to set audacious rather than incremental goals?</strong><br />Absolutely, our CEO Larry Page teaches us to set an audacious target but while you may miss it, what you achieve is greater than if you set a low target.</p> <p><strong>You are on a sabbatical from X?</strong><br />I have a tremendous respect for a company that does things that make the world a better place. Although public opinion sometimes attacks Google, imagine a life without search. I am one of the top execs in Google and I can tell you it is truly not a place about the money, this is a place that is truly about changing the world.</p> <p><strong>When you go back to X what will you be working on?</strong><br />I can tell you but then I\u2019d have to flash you like the <em>Men in Black</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Solve for Happy</em> by Mo Gawdat is published by Bluebird (\u00a314.99).

Less than 80 pages long, it became one of the fastest-selling science books ever, and has now sold a million copies worldwide.

In the Italian professor\u2019s elucidation, physics goes deeper than any other science into the riddle of existence. The laws of physics \u2013 gravity, energy, motion \u2013 underpin those of chemistry, astrophysics and meteorology combined. So an understanding of the world requires some grasp of physics. This book aims to make that grasp easier for the layperson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/16/carlo-rovelli-interview-quantum-gravity-physics-science-is-where-revolutions-happen\">Carlo Rovelli: \u2018Science is where revolutions happen\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It should be noted, however, that <em>Reality</em> first came out in Italy in 2014 before <em>Seven Lessons</em>, so, with this edition translated into English by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre, we are getting Rovelli in reverse order of publication. No matter. In exquisitely written pages he seeks to bridge the divide between what CP Snow called the \u201cTwo Cultures\u201d of science and the arts. According to Rovelli, this divide widened catastrophically in\u00a0Italy after the 1923 fascist school reforms ensured that the classics provided the core curriculum, not science. He has never quite forgiven Italy\u2019s pro-Mussolini philosopher Benedetto Croce for his conviction that \u201cscientific problems are not real ones\u201d (Croce later turned against Mussolini).</p> <p>In a superb chapter on Dante and his conception of paradise and the cosmos, Rovelli writes: \u201cOur culture is foolish to\u00a0keep science and poetry separated,\u201d adding: \u201cthey are two tools to open our eyes to the complexity and beauty of the world.\u201d Like the Italian scientist-writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/primolevi\" title=\"\">Primo Levi</a>, Rovelli sees no incompatibility between the two cultures, only mutual attraction. In Lucretius\u2019s long philosophical poem, <em>On the Nature of Things</em>, he finds a luminous celebration of the mysteries of the natural world that anticipated a\u00a0large part of contemporary physics. Atoms are the sole \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of\u00a0the universe, Lucretius observed. Lucretius did not know it, but he was writing about the quintessential atom of life \u2013 carbon \u2013 at\u00a0a time when atomic theory did not exist. <em>On the Nature of Things</em> only became \u201cmodern\u201d in 1417, however, when the papal scribe and humanist Poggio Bracciolini chanced on the last surviving manuscript of the poem in a German monastery. Subsequently, the poem was translated and disseminated widely. Shakespeare struck a Lucretian note in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, Rovelli writes, where the phantasmagoric Queen Mab is believed to have a \u201cteam of little atomies\u201d at her\u00a0command.</p> <p>Certainly Lucretius was ahead of his\u00a0time. Girolamo Savonarola, the firebrand church reformer of Renaissance Florence, fulminated against his pagan-era theory of atoms, which seemed to militate against Christian absolutism. Throughout, Rovelli repudiates religious fundamentalists of any denomination \u2013 but also rejects the idea that science is ever settled. \u201cThe search for knowledge is not nourished by certainty: it is nourished by a radical distrust in certainty,\u201d he comments in a chapter on loop quantum gravity theory. Scientists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> who pretend to atheist omniscience are, Rovelli argues, no less intolerant or prejudiced; the world is not necessarily as Dawkins thinks it is.</p> <p>Science is not and never has been about certainty. \u201cOnly by keeping in mind that our beliefs may turn out to be wrong is it possible to free ourselves from wrong ideas,\u201d Rovelli writes axiomatically. The joy of physics lies partly in its willingness to be wrong and to explore the world experimentally. Dante\u2019s Ulysses reminds his companions that we are not made \u201cto live like brutes, but to seek virtue and knowledge\u201d. Of course, curiosity-driven researchers such as Galileo Galilei incurred the wrath of the Catholic church in the 17th century by putting divine laws to test and conducting investigations. (\u201cFor in much wisdom is much grief\u201d: Ecclesiastes.) In a brilliant chapter, Rovelli extols Galileo as a proto-physicist who \u201ctasted\u201d the apple of\u00a0knowledge and was jailed by the ecclesiastical authorities for daring to\u00a0exercise his\u00a0curiosity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/05/seven-brief-lessons-on-physics-carlo-rovelli-review\">Seven Brief Lessons on Physics review \u2013 science without the detail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A \u201ccurious\u201d person (from the Latin <em>cura</em>, \u201ccare\u201d) was originally understood to be somebody who undertook investigations with due diligence. One such was the Belgian Jesuit-educated priest Georges Lema\u00eetre, who, in 1927, developed what would become known as Big Bang theory. Nobody would claim that these ideas were easy, but Rovelli writes with bracing clarity of Lema\u00eetre\u2019s discovery that the universe is not fixed, but ever-expanding. The Catholic priest\u00a0personified the modern \u201cstruggle with curiosity\u201d and even what it means to be\u00a0human.</p> <p>Along the way, Rovelli discourses (not always clearly) on spatio-temporal continuums, the infinitude of matter, gravitational waves and other abstract ideas. The \u201creal magic\u201d of 20th-century physics begins with Einstein: his notion that time and space cannot be separated (the concept of \u201cspacetime\u201d) posed a\u00a0threat to the cosy certainties of anti-relativity scientists. Unlike the wafer-thin <em>Lessons</em>, this book by Rovelli will not fit easily into a pocket, but its lapidary integration of science and literature is a marvel. \u201cIs the world not marvellous?\u201d Rovelli asks.

          "body": "<p><strong>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2017/mar/30/guardian-bolsters-award-winning-environment-team\">the Guardian announced</a> that it was expanding its environment desk, adding three heavyweight reporters to its continent-spanning, award-winning team. Here Jonathan Watts, who will take up the new role of global environment editor in a few months\u2019 time, explains why he believes this is the most important story on the planet right now.</strong></p> <p>The environment has always been a subject close to my heart and it has become an increasing focus of my work over two decades with the Guardian. That is no doubt because the problems of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and over-consumption have become bigger and more apparent.</p> <p>When I started out as a cub reporter in Japan in the mid-1990s, I learned a lot collaborating with Paul Brown, then the environment correspondent, on articles about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/oct/02/paulbrown.jonathanwatts\">Tokaimura nuclear accident</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jul/13/globalwarming.climatechange\">Kyoto climate protocol</a>. After moving to China in 2003, I increasingly found myself writing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/11/france.china\">smog</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/07/china-cancer-villages-industrial-pollution\">cancer villages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/nov/24/china.travelnews\">species extinction</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/nov/27/china-carbon-targets-climate-change\">carbon emissions.</a> The ramping up of environmental stories was not a deliberate strategy. China\u2019s crisis was so bad that it was impossible to ignore. This made for grim news, but it also made me hopeful that it might be a fulcrum for change. </p> <p>After the Olympics in 2008, I switched jobs to become Asia environment correspondent. In this post, I covered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/20/copenhagen-climate-global-warming\">Copenhagen Climate Conference</a> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/23/john-vidal-environment-editor-greatest-job-on-earth\">John Vidal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/suzannegoldenberg\">Suzanne Goldenberg</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/27/biodiversity-loss-terrorism\">Nagoya biodiversity conference</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/fukushima-japan-nuclear-disaster-aftermath\">Fukushima tsunami </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-nuclear-meltdown-fukushima-reactor\">nuclear disaster</a>; and the rapid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/19/china-windfarms-renewable-energy\">growth of wind and solar power </a>in the deserts of China. For the past five years, I have been the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, writing on a broader range of subjects but still putting a priority on environment and development, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/14/brazil-amazon-rangers-farmers-burning\">Amazon deforestation</a>, killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/dying-to-save-amazonian-rainforest-brazil\">conservation activists</a>, the role of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/02/indigenous-rights-forests-climate-change-study\">indigenous communities</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/09/amazon-tribe-protecting-forest-bows-arrows-gps-camera-traps\">forest protection</a>  and the disturbing frequency of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/25/chile-fire-firefighting-international-help\">forest fires</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/17/peru-floods-ocean-climate-change\">floods</a> and other extreme weather events.</p> <p>So why am I going back into full-time, specialised environmental reporting? Because it is the <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4876--The-world-s-most-important-story-\">most important story of our age</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/18/china-birth-of-superpower\">China led me to suspect</a> that global economic growth had run into an ecological wall, which is the underlying source of stress and conflict in the world. When I moved to Latin America, I hoped to find alternative, less destructive paths of development, but there was a part of me that also felt I was running away from my own conclusions. The new post will take me back.</p> <p>The responsibility is huge. The timing is crucial. Brexit was a vote against globalisation. Trump is waging war on the environment. To counter these trends, the Guardian has devoted more resources to its environment coverage. I am looking forward to being a part of an expanded team, but we have a tough act to follow. Brown, Vidal, George Monbiot, Damian Carrington and other present and former colleagues have been pioneers in this field with agenda-setting coverage and comment. Trying to maintain that quality, ambition and influence \u2013 while looking for new approaches to changing situations \u2013 will be a hard but worthwhile task.</p> <p>As to the task that humanity faces, I think the problem and the solution are environmental. The world\u2019s current concerns - rising nationalism, swelling migration, financial instability, worsening inequality and lack of confidence in governance systems - are to varying degrees caused by insecurity and fear about the future. Underlying that is an awareness (conscious or unconscious) that our current path of capital-and-carbon-driven development is wrecking our home planet, running down resources, devastating other species and building up environmental costs that are increasingly difficult to offload on distant countries and coming generations. We have to pay a bill that has been run up over centuries and it feels as if we are broke. But that is misleading. There is still plenty left if we manage it well and share it more fairly.</p> <p>We need to reconsider what is important, what is worth paying for and how decisions are being made. At a national level, why are we devoting so much public money to subsidise fossil fuels that are destroying the climate? Why are most politics determined by four-, five- or six-year electoral cycles that suit the markets but not the long-term interests of voters? Why do our economic systems make it cheaper to dump plastic in the oceans than recycle? Why do traditional beliefs of some countries encourage the slaughter of endangered animals or denial of climate science? Why are forests worth less than cropland? Why do we continue to prioritise material growth when it increasingly leads to obesity, cancer, conflict and instability?</p> <p>The key, I think, is to realise that, contrary to what Bill Clinton once said - it\u2019s not \u201cthe economy, stupid!\u201d - it is in fact the environment that is shaping everything. Which is to say that we must put our home in order before we can consider anything else. That is tough. Currently, political systems are skewed against the environment and the subject is hidden away in a media ghetto. It is a depressing page on a news website or an unpopular slot on TV channels. Most of us would prefer to pretend it didn\u2019t exist. Yet, for me the environment is not a subject, it is the prism through which everything else must be seen. It is the basis for the economy, for science, for society, for politics. Adam Smith, Albert Einstein, Karl Marx and Mao Zedong never understood this. Nor did the founders of the great religions. They didn\u2019t need to. They did not live in the Anthropocene.</p> <p>So, how to put the environment front and centre is the big challenge. Following my predecessors, I will continue to visit the frontline of humankind\u2019s impact on the natural world \u2013 the oceans, forests, mountains, deserts, poles, science labs, conference halls and affected communities \u2013 where I will continue to bear witness and record testimonies of change. But they are just symptoms. I hope I can also work with and encourage my colleagues on other news desks to consider the environment in their coverage of politics, social change, economics, psychology, art, religion and education. Those areas, close to home, perhaps inside our heads, are where we will find the cause and the cure. It\u2019s time to colonise the colonisers.</p> <p>We are all entering disconcerting new territory. Given demographic, economic and consumerist trends, the next 30 years will be difficult. But there is more than enough new knowledge and technology, as well as old philosophy and religion to make things much better. It is all about choices and action.</p> <p>\u2022 If you have any new ideas, collaborations or story suggestions for the new environmental reporting team, please email membershipeditorial@theguardian.com</p> <p><br /></p>",

En route, he meets the Mast Brothers (beards and chocolates), the owners of Shoreditch\u2019s Cereal Killer Cafe (beards and Cheerios) and eminently sensible advertising guru Sir John Hegarty (beardless). <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>The Gun Shop: Cutting Edge</strong><br /></h2> <h2>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>This show is in the Cutting Edge strand but so light is its tone, it might easily be a new reality show. Which tells its own story, of course, about how differently guns are seen here and in the US, where there are some 65,000 gun dealers. In Battle Creek, Michigan, the likable, right-leaning Joel runs Freedom Firearms, where the answer to a customer\u2019s experience of road rage is to sell him a Glock 43 in Tiffany Blue. Subtly terrifying. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2><strong>Paranoid </strong><br />9pm, ITV</h2> <p>Inept policing has been one of this stuttering thriller\u2019s many frustrations: even the greenest TV sleuth should know to arrest Michael Maloney on sight. Now his smarmy shrink has finally become of interest to the cops investigating the murder of a GP, they might be on the verge of busting a global conspiracy to pump us all full of drugs. If it\u2019s not global, it at least extends to D\u00fcsseldorf, where cheerful detective Linda has been hiding something about her past. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier </strong><br />9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy \u2013 and indeed appropriate \u2013 to laugh at Donald Trump. But we should be both worried and angry, too: at his cynicism, at his opportunism, at his disregard for truth and at the ominous societal currents his rise reflects. This film explores the various conspiracy theories \u2013 from Obama\u2019s birth certificate to Ted Cruz\u2019s father \u2013 that Trump has attempted to exploit, and runs the rule over the ignoble history of conspiracy in US politics since Watergate. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow <br />8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>DC Comics meets Doctor Who in this time-travelling superhero show. Season two kicks off with a reshuffled squad of second-string goodies and baddies \u2013 including an Iron Man knockoff, a belligerent arsonist and a bisexual ninja \u2013 protecting the timestream from attack. Musketeer outfits, dinosaurs, a Nazi atomic bomb and a lecherous cameo from Einstein suggest Legends Of Tomorrow has lost none of its berserk, action-packed charm. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>The Apprentice <br />9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Week five for the tyro tycoons, with the bedraggled contenders dragged out of bed at 5am for a rendezvous at Stratford\u2019s Lee Valley VeloPark. The task: peddling a crowdfunded gadget to ease the lot of city cyclists, with options including high-end safety gilets and traffic-aware earbuds. Will the teams concoct clickworthy content that can lure thousands of cyclists to their funding pages within an inaugural 24 hours? Or just bicker relentlessly about hashtags? <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2>The Young Pope <br />9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s series is sure to get right up the robes of the Catholic establishment with its impious use of imagery. Worse for them are its central assumptions that Jude Law (AKA \u201cLenny\u201d, Pope Pius XIII) might somehow land the position of Pope and that the Vatican\u2019s cardinals are a scheming and manipulative bunch. Tonight, in the face of further plotting, Pius divides public opinion at a press conference but does gain one new follower. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Hunger</strong> (Steve McQueen, 2008), 1.15am, Film4 </p> <p>New BFI fellow Steve McQueen\u2019s debut feature is an intense account of the last weeks in the life of the IRA\u2019s Bobby Sands. It\u2019s a nightmarish vision of the dirty protest \u2013 when the inmates of the Maze prison\u2019s H-block used faeces and urine to rebel against Thatcher and the authorities who refused to designate them as political prisoners \u2013 and Sands\u2019s fatal hunger strike, portrayed with stunning conviction by Michael Fassbender. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Tennis: The Paris Masters </strong>Coverage of the fourth day at the AccorHotels Arena in Paris. 10am, Sky Sports 1<br /></p> <p><strong>Europa League Football: Southampton v Inter Milan </strong>The Serie A team visit the south coast\u2019s St Mary\u2019s Stadium. 7.45pm, BT Sport 2</p> <p><strong>NFL: Tampa Bay Buccaneers v Atlanta Falcons </strong>Coverage of the NFC South clash at the Raymond James Stadium. 12.30am, Sky Sports 1</p>",

          "body": "<p>The Daily Mirror was famous for promoting women journalists, such as Marje Proops and Felicity Green. Less well known, but just as significant, was Doreen Spooner, reputed to be the first female photographer to have a staff job on a popular paper.</p> <p>Now 88, and almost 30 years after retiring from the Mirror, she has just written her autobiography, Camera Girl (an ironic choice of title, as will become clear).*</p> <p>She tells of her various assignments, which included a variety of hard news stories, features portraits and fashion shoots. </p> <p>Spooner was as much at home taking pictures in Northern Ireland during the troubles as she was snapping scantily clad models in the studio.</p> <p>Newspapers were in her blood: her father, Len, was art editor of the Daily Herald. After a college course and a brief spell with a photo agency, she joined the Mirror in 1949 and soon after won an award for her portrait of playwright George Bernard Shaw at his garden gate. </p> <p>She left to freelance, first in America and then in Paris. She met and married another photographer, Pierre Vandeputte-Manevy, had three children and returned to London in the late 1950s. </p> <p>Marital difficulties, exacerbated by financial problems, persuaded Spooner to go back to work and she regained her Mirror position.</p> <p>It was in the summer of 1963, during the Profumo affair, that she landed her first front page scoop, a candid shot of Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies in a pub before they gave evidence in the trial of Stephen Ward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"80cefb32ef609065ea8f53651a9640543702518a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80cefb32ef609065ea8f53651a9640543702518a/1_0_853_1066/800.png\" alt=\"Spooner\u2019s scoop: 23 July, 1963.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spooner\u2019s scoop: 23 July, 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DAILY MIRROR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She managed to get off just one shot before she realised the landlord had spotted her. Before he approached, she removed the film and hid it inside her coat.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI knew in my gut I\u2019d got it,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/britains-first-female-photographer-broke-9006039\">she told the Sunday Mirror</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to take photos \u2013 but so much harder to get \u2018the picture\u2019, the image that somehow captures the essence of the people in the frame.</p> <p>\u201cBut right there in my lens I\u2019d seen it \u2013 Christine Keeler, eyes down, fragile, and Mandy Rice-Davies looking straight ahead in a cocky blonde beehive. I\u2019d got the contrast of personalities\u201d.</p> <p>Spooner was also relieved that the byline no longer said, as it had when she first joined the paper, \u201cby Camera Girl Doreen Spooner\u201d. She said: \u201cThat was a bloody cheek. I think they thought it endearing, but I wasn\u2019t having it\u201d.</p> <p>She also talked of male-dominated Fleet Street being \u201cTestosterone Alley\u201d, saying \u201cI like to think I played a small part in changing attitudes \u2013 never waving a feminist flag, just by getting on with my job...</p> <p>\u201cThe excitement was intoxicating. I loved the buzz involved in creating a paper and getting it out to every corner of Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Among those jobs was coverage of the miners\u2019 strike, the Greenham Common protests and the Zeebrugge disaster in 1987 when the car ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, capsized, killing 193 people.<br /></p> <p>Spooner took pictures of \u201cpoor traumatised people, lying in their hospital beds, poleaxed by the horror that had befallen them\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ed68900814fdbb3801b53ccfa043d6c39c41fb9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed68900814fdbb3801b53ccfa043d6c39c41fb9a/0_45_342_428/342.png\" alt=\".\" width=\"342\" height=\"428\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirror Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is, naturally enough, happier to recall less stressful assignments in which she took photos of celebrities. Some, however, were anything but helpful subjects.</p> <p>Albert Einstein, for instance, \u201cwasn\u2019t a happy bunny\u201d, and Sophia Loren \u201cnever cracked a smile\u201d, although she looked beautiful all the same.</p> <p>Several examples of her portfolio can be found <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/iconic-images-royals-actors-intellectuals-9012474\">here on the Mirror site</a> and also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-37749923\">on the BBC website</a>, which includes a superb portrait of composer Leonard Bernstein.</p> <p>Spooner did a great deal of studio work too. <a href=\"http://www.gentlemenranters.com/30.html#spooner\">According to William Boot</a>, who may not have been the most reliable of sources, a female model once remarked: \u201cYou never mind getting your kit off for Doreen. It\u2019s like undressing in front of your granny\u201d.</p> <p>*Camera Girl by Doreen Spooner with Alan Clark (Mirror Books) <a href=\"http://www.mirrorcollection.co.uk/products/details/camera_girl/CameraGirl/\">can be ordered here, with free delivery</a>.<br /></p>",

          "body": "<p>As any young Earth creationist will confirm, the BBC occasionally fails in its objective of due impartiality. Only last week, it reported on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/31/oldest-fossils-on-earth-discovered-in-37bn-year-old-greenland-rocks-stromatolites\" title=\"\">fossil find in Greenland</a>, without bothering to balance this with a contribution from a fundamentalist Christian, such as Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence.</p> <p>If the US might seem like a long way to go for comment, the BBC\u2019s referendum coverage demonstrated that, when balance is at stake, a contributor\u2019s passion can be quite as compelling a qualification as his or her expertise, reputation or, even, connection with the subject under discussion. Moreover, Pence has a long acquaintance with creationism.</p> <p>It was never clear, at least to this listener, why Steve Hilton, a US resident who once fell out with the last prime minister, became one of the anti-EU stars of the BBC\u2019s Brexit coverage, to the point of assisting with analysis on referendum night. But in line with BBC impartiality guidelines that are enforced, arguably to the point of misrepresentation, when the corporation feels threatened, he was no doubt balanced by a yet more embittered \u2013 but pro-Remain \u2013 ex-Cameron adviser with a similarly touristic stake in the outcome.</p> <p>To be fair to Mr Hilton, he could hardly be blamed for embracing a dazzling career in EU punditry when the BBC pressed it upon him, nor was his inexplicable prominence the most bizarre or regrettable aspect of the coverage which, according to polling by the Electoral Reform Society, played the biggest part in the referendum in keeping the British public informed. Throughout a debate the ERS describes as \u201cdire\u201d, the BBC was the source of information most commonly cited as important. The final level of public understanding, after a four-month campaign, is well illustrated, says its new <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/publication/Its-good-to-talk-2016-EU-Referendum-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a>, by the great spike on 24 June in the number of people googling \u201cWhat is the EU?\u201d \u201cWe would argue,\u201d say the authors, \u201cthat the levels of knowledge reported by members of the public were too low throughout.\u201d This, despite demonstrably high levels of public interest and lavish airtime for the individuals they describe as \u201cbig beasts\u201d.</p> <p>Among their recommendations for better informed plebiscites, as referendums become more commonplace, are longer campaign periods and an independent body empowered to correct misleading statements such as the untruth \u2013 holy writ according to Gisela Stuart, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u2013 that Britain sends a weekly \u00a3350m to the EU. Further public understanding might be achieved, it says, if broadcasters attempted more \u201cdeliberative\u201d as opposed to tit-for-tat coverage of the type that infuriated complainants to the BBC\u2019s <em>Feedback</em> programme long before they could be written off as sore losers.</p> <p>If there are pointed lessons here for some BBC programme-makers, who must bear partial responsibility for the final level of public bafflement, maybe they shouldn\u2019t be blamed for submitting to management orders, issued when the now forgotten escort fan and culture secretary, John Whittingdale, was emitting worrying noises. The EU referendum <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/guidelines/appendix8/due-impartiality\" title=\"\">guidelines</a> effectively ordained that BBC coverage would adhere, in the aim of impartiality, to traditional, binary practices, despite this being a non-party political debate to which any number of non-affiliated, non big beasts might have more insights to contribute than Westminster\u2019s in-fighters.

They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said, \u2018Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor me,\u201d writes Professor John van Reenen, formerly of the LSE, now at MIT and one of the economists thus likened by Gove to an antisemitic, government-owned Nazi, \u201cit simply capped off a frankly disgusting campaign, one where the Leave side simply impugned the motives of \u2018the experts\u2019 rather than seriously engaging with the substance of the economic debate.\u201d</p> <p>But the Leave side might not have got away with this ugliness, nor Remain with prattling about imminent apocalypse, had not the BBC, as well as enabling an often asinine level of argument, allowed its obsession with balance to dictate that any carefully argued observation on Brexit, deserving of analysis, be promptly followed by its formal opponent\u2019s unsubstantiated bluster.</p> <p>Similarly, no more attention would be devoted to a striking near-consensus of economic opinion than to its negation by a speaker representing a groupuscule of eight. Admittedly, this was tough on the eight. Professor Patrick Minford was working hours to which no elderly economist should be subjected. But that\u2019s just one of the costs of the BBC\u2019s \u201cregulated <a href=\"http://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-3-news/regulated-equivocation-the-referendum-on-radio\" title=\"\">equivocation</a>\u201d, as its critics call a habit that has previously embarrassed the corporation when applied to climate change and the MMR. Until recently, it considered the climate change denier Nigel Lawson as fine a match for peer-reviewed research as it now believes him a trusted guarantor of post-Brexit glories, possibly forgetting his earlier history of shadowing the deutschmark.</p> <p>In his 2011 <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">report</a> on BBC science coverage, the geneticist Professor Steve Jones criticised the \u201cover-rigid\u201d insistence on due impartiality that could give \u201cundue attention to marginal opinion\u201d. But once again, in referendum coverage, the corporation actively required its journalists to supply this phony balance, even when that meant, as Jones put it on science, allowing rhetoric \u2013 say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/michael-gove-likens-uk-remaining-in-eu-to-hostage-situation\" title=\"\">Gove\u2019s \u201chostages\u201d in a car</a> \u2013 \u201cto give the appearance of debate\u201d.</p> <p>As with climate change, implicit in extreme BBC impartiality is a distinctly un-BBC like, post-truth proposal that, since all opinions merit equal coverage, the public might as well give up on evidence-based argument. So much was plainly stated by <em>Today</em>\u2019s Nick Robinson when he assured voters who were, in huge numbers, seeking information from the BBC that the debate was all \u201cclaims and counterclaims\u201d, \u201cguesswork\u201d. \u201cNo journalist,\u201d he declared, \u201cno pundit, no expert can resolve these questions for you.\u201d Whether the imaginary \u00a3350m claimed by Johnson and Gove would ever be imaginarily spent on the NHS was not, it presumably followed, a lie for the BBC to repeatedly expose, but \u201ca matter of judgment\u201d.</p> <p>Whichever side you were on, the BBC\u2019s coverage was not, as the ERS is not the first to point out, such as to create unalloyed confidence in the outcome. Even the winners would discover, shortly after voting, that one big beast (Gove) had never meant it about the NHS\u2019s \u00a3350m; that another (Hannan) saw no connection with reduced immigration. That ERS idea, the official fact checker, has already been derided as a \u201cstuck-up quango\u201d. But would the ERS be asking if the BBC had done its job?</p>",

          "body": "<p>Fritz Stern, who has died aged 90, was one of a remarkable generation of German-Jewish exiles from Nazi Germany who rose to become leading figures in the American historical profession. He was best known for two highly influential books, The Politics of Cultural Despair (1961), which traced the origins of Nazi antisemitism through a study of three far-right authors in late 19th-century Germany, and Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichr\u00f6der and the Building of the German Empire (1977), which traced the intimate, complex and often surprising relationship between the founder of imperial Germany and his Jewish personal banker.</p> <p>His many other publications included Einstein\u2019s German World (1999), several collections of essays, including The Failure of Illiberalism (1972) and Dreams and Delusions (1987), and a remarkable autobiography, Five Germanys I Have Known (2006).</p> <p>Stern was far more than a historian of German-Jewish relations, however. From 1954 onwards he lectured frequently at the Free University of Berlin, and this brought him a growing recognition in the Federal Republic of Germany as an eloquent and wise proponent of reconciliation between Germans and Jews based on an honest and sober assessment of the past. He was called on to address the German parliament, he spoke at the German army headquarters, where Claus von Stauffenberg was executed after the failure of his attempt to kill Hitler in July 1944, on the anniversary of the plot, and he was accorded many honours in Germany. He was, as the New York Times once reported, something of a \u201cmoral arbiter\u201d and \u201cperhaps the closest thing to a trusted external judge of the country\u2019s bitter internal debates\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his memoirs, he described how as a schoolboy he was subjected to the antisemitism of Nazi teachers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His reputation in Germany also brought him into contact with the world of politics and diplomacy. In 1990 he was one of the participants in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>\u2019s notorious Chequers seminar on German unification, where he joined with other experts in vainly trying to persuade the then prime minister that unification was not a threat to European peace and deserved to be supported. In 1993-94 he served as a special adviser to the US ambassador to Germany, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/14/richard-holbrooke-obituary\" title=\"\">Richard Holbrooke</a>. By this time he had attained an eminence far beyond the world of academia.</p> <p>Stern was born in Breslau, then a city in the Weimar Republic, now Wroc\u0142aw in Poland, to a well-connected professional family of Jewish converts to Christianity. His father, Rudolf, was a prominent physician, and his mother, Catherine (nee Brieger), an educationist who had gained a doctorate in physics, an unusual achievement at the time. Fritz was named after his godfather Fritz Haber, a Nobel prize-winning chemist, and when he wanted advice on whether to follow his father\u2019s footsteps and become a doctor, or his own inclinations and become an historian, it was to Albert Einstein that he turned.</p> <p>Under the Third Reich, the situation of the Sterns, like that of all Germans classified by the Nazis as Jews, deteriorated rapidly. In his memoirs, he described how as a schoolboy he was subjected to the antisemitism of Nazi teachers, one of whom, in a maths lesson, posed the question: \u201cIf three Jews robbed a bank, and each got a part of the loot proportionate to their ages \u2026 how much would each get?\u201d</p> <p>In 1938 the family emigrated to the US, where they settled in New York. Fritz learned English and acquired the complete command of the language that enabled him later on to write with grace and style. He studied at Columbia University, where he began by taking the pre-med course but was enthralled by the classes he attended with Lionel Trilling and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/29/jacques-barzun\" title=\"\">Jacques Barzun</a>. It was at this point that he asked Einstein for advice: medicine or history? \u201cThat\u2019s simple: medicine is a science, and history is not,\u201d Einstein said. \u201cHence medicine.\u201d</p> <p>Fritz was confident enough to ignore this advice and took his bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1946, his master\u2019s in 1948 and his doctorate, later published as The Politics of Cultural Despair, in 1953. Even before he had completed it, he began teaching at Cornell University, moving back to Columbia when he had obtained his doctorate. He became a full professor in 1963, and was appointed to the prestigious Seth Low professorship in 1967, becoming university professor in 1992. He was briefly provost, from 1980 to 1983, and retired in 1996.</p> <p>\u201cThough I lived in National Socialist Germany for only five years,\u201d he wrote in the introduction to his memoirs, \u201cthat brief period saddled me with the burning question that I have spent my professional life trying to answer: Why and how did the universal potential for evil become an actuality in Germany?\u201d He rejected simplistic answers, derived from wartime propaganda, that sought to portray Germans as predestined to evil.</p> <p>He intervened decisively in the impassioned debate aroused by the thesis of the young American political scientist Daniel Jonah Goldhagen in the late 1990s, that German national identity was indelibly stamped with \u201celiminationist antisemitism\u201d from the outset. This was, he said, nothing less than \u201cthe indictment of a people\u201d and it would not withstand historical scrutiny.</p> <p>Indeed, he went on to excoriate \u201call the tomes and slogans about Germany\u2019s inevitable path \u2018from Luther to Hitler\u2019.\u201d \u201cDecades of study and experience have persuaded me,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat the German roads to perdition, including National Socialism, were neither accidental nor inevitable.\u201d Nazism had deep roots, yet it was an \u201cavoidable disaster\u201d.</p> <p>In his many essays, he expounded this view in many different ways. His masterpiece, however, was Gold and Iron, a book as long, detailed and compelling as any of the great realist novels of the 19th century. Drawing on Bleichr\u00f6der\u2019s personal papers, which had only recently come to light, the book used the vast and previously unknown correspondence between the banker and the chancellor to paint an intense portrait of the clash of the two worlds they represented \u2013 Jewish high finance on the one hand, right-wing German high politics on the other. The \u201cGerman-Jewish symbiosis\u201d that lay at the heart of the creation of the German empire in 1871 was sustained by the financial dealings with which Gerson von Bleichr\u00f6der gave Bismarck much of the funding he needed to pursue his political goals.</p> <p>It was, as Stern freely admitted, a story that had many unedifying aspects, from the chancellor\u2019s brutal opportunism to the banker\u2019s fawning subservience. Yet the book delineated with superb literary skill a whole world about which little had been known before, and underlined the central role of the Jewish community in German life before the rise of antisemitism towards the end of the 19th century began to undermine it.</p> <p>Stern was in many ways a traditional historian, his practice rooted in the cultural approach he had learned from Barzun and Trilling in his student days. This approach was already being overtaken by the sociological methods of a younger generation of German historians in the 1970s. Yet the sheer quality and readability of his work has ensured its lasting value, and it remains indispensable reading for all students of modern German history.</p> <p>Stern\u2019s first marriage, to Margaret Bassett, ended in divorce. His second wife, Elisabeth Sifton, daughter of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, co-authored his last book with him: No Ordinary Men (2013) was a study of two figures in the German resistance to Hitler, Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. She survives him, along with Frederick and Katherine, the children of his first marriage; his stepsons, Sam, Toby and John; three grandchildren; four step-grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Fritz Richard Stern, historian, born 2 February 1926; died 18 May 2016</p>",

If the 43-year-old\u2019s legal team can convince a judge that this contribution possesses the spark of genius then he could prevail, under a precedent set by the man who earned his fortune from introducing black plastic bin liners to the UK. </p> <p> </p> <p>Giggs\u2019s lawyers this week told the high court that they will call witnesses to prove that he is a genius and contributed far more to his 10-year marriage than his spouse Stacey Cooke. They argued this should trump law that states homebuilding and companionship are of equal importance to breadwinning. </p> <p>However, one legal expert warned that the strategy is high-risk. \u201cNo judge likes the idea of people spending huge amounts to legally brag about their own self-imagined genius,\u201d said David Ruck, a partner and divorce specialist at law firm Gordon Dadds. \u201cThe courts are very reluctant to describe what a special contribution is\u201d, adding that it has only been acknowledged in a handful of cases where \u201cthe sums are massive\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f13f5bea940ac7f2ff8398b130cb27a582c8115\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f13f5bea940ac7f2ff8398b130cb27a582c8115/102_91_1998_2495/801.jpg\" alt=\"Randy Work, who this week lost his claim to more than half of a \u00a3140m fortune.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Randy Work, who this week lost his claim to more than half of a \u00a3140m fortune.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Giggs succeeds, he will be one of only a handful of men to have successfully convinced an English court that his financial contribution to marriage should overrule the \u201cyardstick of equality\u201d which means the lesser-earning spouse is entitled to half of the assets in a divorce.</p> <p>In the past fortnight, two other multimillionaire husbands \u2013 American banker Randy Work and Laura Ashley chairman Khoo Kay Peng \u2013 have failed to have their genius recognised by the courts.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/judges-reject-us-bankers-claim-to-be-randy-work-genius-in-divorce-case\"> Work, 49, was forced to pay \u00a372m to his ex-wife</a>, while 78-year-old <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/06/laura-ashley-boss-to-pay-ex-wife-divorce-settlement-of-64m\">Khoo was required to settle for \u00a364m</a>. </p> <p>The precedent that Giggs is relying on was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/15/claredyer\">set in 2001</a> when the court of appeal judges ruled that Michael Cowan could keep 62% of the \u00a312m bin liner fortune he shared with his wife because \u201chis contribution, in terms of entrepreneurial flair, inventiveness and hard work, was truly exceptional\u201d.</p> <p>Since that ruling, many wealthy men have also tried to claim they are geniuses and should also be able collect more than half of their family\u2019s finances, but few have succeeded in convincing judges that they are as exceptional as Cowan. </p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising firm WPP was awarded 60% of the \u00a375m joint assets in his 2005 divorce from Sandra, his wife of 33 years. Mr Justice Bennett ruled that Sorrell was \u201cregarded within his field and the wider business community as one of the most exceptional and most talented businessmen\u201d. Bennett said the \u201ctrue explanation for this extraordinary success story is that the husband does possess the \u2018spark\u2019 or \u2018force\u2019 or \u2018seed\u2019 of genius\u201d. And with that the so-called \u201cgenius\u201d clause was born. </p> <p>The next year, insurance magnate John Charman was awarded 63.5% of the \u00a3131m marital fortune because \u201cthe wealth created is of extraordinary proportions from extraordinary talent and energy\u201d. In 2014, Jamie Cooper-Hohn, ex-wife of Chris Hohn, the billionaire founder of hedge fund The Children\u2019s Investment Fund Management, was awarded just 36% of their $1.5bn fortune.</p> <p>But far more husbands have tried and failed to invoke the genius clause. This week, American private equity tycoon Work failed to convince the court of appeal to recognise his genius and grant him more than half of a \u00a3140m fortune, which included a \u00a330m mansion in Kensington, west London, complete with swimming pool and fitness centre, and an \u00a318m ski lodge in Aspen, Colorado.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The court of appeal agreed with an earlier ruling that it would be \u201cunjustifiably gender-discriminatory to make an unequal award. This was a marriage of two strong and equal partners over 20 years.\u201d</p> <p>Ruling on their divorce in 2015, Mr Justice Holman told the businessman that his wealth contribution was not \u201cwholly exceptional\u201d and rejected his claim to be a financial \u201cgenius\u201d. \u201cI personally find that a difficult, and perhaps unhelpful, word in this context,\u201d Holman said. \u201cTo my mind, the word \u2018genius\u2019 tends to be overused and is properly reserved for Leonardo da Vinci, Mozart, Einstein and others like them.\u201d</p> <p>In Cowan\u2019s case, his legal team did not stint on claiming the word \u201cgenius\u201d applied to their client. Speaking at a court of appeal hearing in 2001, Cowan\u2019s lawyer compared his client to \u201ca popular musician who achieves worldwide success, or a novelist with international bestsellers.\u201d Martin Pointer QC added: \u201cThese are people who have the spark of genius, the Midas touch, and Mr Cowan falls into that category.

But it has only been so since 2000, when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/27/claredyer\">a landmark divorce case</a> was taken to the House of Lords. Pamela White complained that she had originally been granted just \u00a3800,000 of the \u00a34.6m farming fortune she had made with her husband Martin White. \u201cThe Lords said to family lawyers, \u2018look you\u2019ve been getting this wrong, you should be starting at a 50/50 split and then looking to see if there is any good reason to depart from equality,\u201d said Jo Edwards, a partner and head of family law at London law firm Forsters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/19/divorce-women-risk-poverty-children-relationship\">The biggest financial risk for women today?

          "body": "<p>In 1993 I spoke to my father by phone: he was living in Hawaii and I in London. He sounded confused, as if he was struggling for words. He was 88, and I discovered that he had had a number of small strokes, so that his speech was affected. I decided I should fly to Hawaii and see for myself.</p> <p>My father was a successful artist and had a beautiful waterfront house on the windward shore of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/15/top-10-national-state-parks-hawaii\">Oahu</a>. He loved Hawaii, his pictures were well known and sold well, and he was very happy with Hope, his third wife. However, when I arrived, it was clear that he was in the early stages of dementia.</p> <p>But his personality remained unaffected, and we sat on his deck and were able to talk, after a fashion. At one point he started talking about matter, space and rotation. It was all very garbled, but I knew what he was trying to say.</p> <p>He was trying, still, to explain the Theory.</p> <p>The Theory! My father had worked on it in his spare time for the whole of his adult life. He had told my mother about it when they first met in the 1920s, and it was nothing less than a Theory of Everything \u2013 the kind Stephen Hawking has talked about.</p> <p>My father knew nothing about modern physics and there was no prospect of him learning such things, as he never got on with formal education of any sort. But he saw this as no problem. I suspect he was impressed by Albert Einstein, who became quite a media star during my father\u2019s youth. Unknown clerk in Swiss patent office revolutionises modern physics! Well, if Einstein could do it, why couldn\u2019t he?</p> <p>It should be clear at this point that my father had invincible self-belief. He was convinced that if he thought about what made the universe tick for long enough, he could figure out the answer.</p> <p>Basically, as far as I can understand (and I can say, without fear of contradiction, that I understand more about the Theory than any other living person), the universe is made of some kind of conscious \u201cstuff\u201d, and that this stuff circulates and eddies, and as it does so, it rubs against itself. Being conscious, it enjoys certain angles of rubbing, and the circles and eddies create atoms, molecules, energy, forces, etc, etc.</p> <p>But above its role in the makeup of the universe, the Theory came to have a very important role in my relationship with my father because, from a very early age, I saw very little of him.</p> <p>I was born when my mother was 40 and my father had a studio in Greenwich Village, New York, and didn\u2019t return home for days at a time. He said he needed the studio to pursue his art, and rumour had it that he also used it to pursue various women. Then he met Hope and soon asked for a divorce. My mother spent the rest of her life telling me, endlessly, how badly he had treated her, how she had supported him and he had cast her aside. Well, that was true, but kind of hard for a child of nine or 10 to hear.</p> <p>My father did regularly pay child support. Other than that, he would come once a week and take me to dinner. He would drink a martini and, while I was eating my shrimp cocktail, talk about his Theory. Aged about 10 or 11, I was very interested in science. My father never asked me about school or what I was doing; instead he talked about the Theory. I remember him saying once that he thought I was beginning to understand it, which must have reflected my skill in concealing my total bafflement.</p> <p>He also assured me that the Theory would have profound consequences throughout the world. In particular, it would end the cold war. You see, he would say, the Russians, being very logical people, would realise the truth of his Theory, and thus realise that the universe was, in a sense, conscious. Thus the universe could be considered a kind of God. When the Russians saw that they had to abandon atheism, they would understand that Marxism as a whole was incorrect, and would cease their evil communist ways and become good capitalists!</p> <p>When I grew older, my father and Hope moved to Hawaii and I seldom saw him, aside from very occasional visits to Hawaii and one visit he and Hope made to London. But the drafts of the Theory never stopped arriving.</p> <p>Each would be between three and eight pages long, written in incomprehensible prose. A typical sentence might read, \u201cImagine a moving place that travels through distance with force.\u201d As draft followed draft, I struggled to make any meaningful comment. If you wrote with a question, like \u201cWhat is a moving place?\u201d or how does moving with force differ from moving without force, you never received an answer, but only an equally incomprehensible new draft. There was almost never any mathematics in it. Also, and this is key, there were never any empirical predictions. When Newton hypothesised the existence of a universal force of gravity, he wrote equations to predict the motion of the planets. For example, scientists planning space probes still use Newton\u2019s equations to plot their flight. My father\u2019s Theory was useless. Why do the planets move as they do? Because the universal stuff makes them do so!</p> <p>At one point, my father went as far as to pay $1,500 to publish a draft of the Theory as an advert in the Wall Street Journal. He was convinced that the captains of industry \u2013 whom my father\u2019s rightwing view led him to believe were all highly intelligent men \u2013 would beat a path to his door and force the blinkered scientific establishment to pay attention to his views. Surprisingly, nothing happened.</p> <p>I suppose this prompts the question, was my father mad? He was certainly delusional on the subject of his Theory. And certainly he could be described as narcissistic. But he had a successful job, a happy marriage, a beautiful home, a large circle of friends \u2013 by most criteria, he was a success. Although he didn\u2019t make much of a success of parenting.</p> <p>And so, to fast forward, at 88, in the early stages of dementia, my father was still struggling to articulate his Theory. I spent about a week in Hawaii, and late in the week, we were watching Murder She Wrote, one of his favourite shows. He looked confused and asked what was on. We told him. \u201cOh,\u201d he said in satisfaction, \u201cMurder She Wrote.\u201d These were his last words. He was rushed to hospital but to no avail.</p> <p>I remember going back to his house and, late that night, pouring myself a bourbon and talking to Hope, for the first time, about my father. She spoke about how happy he had made her and how much they had loved one another. At one point I said, \u201cWell, Hope, I don\u2019t suppose we\u2019ll be hearing any more about the Theory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, the Theory!\u201d she said, and laughed. And, in the midst of her sadness, that laugh conveyed a small sense of relief.</p>",

          "body": "<p>A little background on my oeuvre: about nine years ago I wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/27/ruby-wax-losing-it-live\">a show called Losing It</a>. It was conceived because Comic Relief put big posters of me around the UK that read: \u201cOne in four people have mental illness, one in five people have dandruff, I have both.\u201d I had assumed it would just be a small photo, so I was a tad surprised by their extra large size. I decided to write a show and pretend those were my publicity posters. I took my illness on the road and sold a lot of tickets for the next few years.<br /></p> <p>Wherever I took the show, after the interval, I let the audience have a turn to speak \u2013 and speak out they did. Sometimes I\u2019d have to turn out the lights to get them to stop talking. I realised from these discussions that everyone feels crazy, which prompted me to write a new book and show, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rubywax.net/sanenewworld.html\">Sane New World</a>, to find out exactly why that was. Why can we run the Hadron Collider and yet can\u2019t run our own minds? We have no manual now and never did. We have to work, breed, die, fight gravity, get smart, stay slim, be nice \u2013 all with absolutely no idea how or why.</p> <p> The problem is there are a number of evolutionary hiccups that were never ironed out; glitches in the mothership. Part of our brain still functions as if it is hundreds of thousands of years ago and we haven\u2019t yet learned to adjust our dials for the 21st century. Rather than going on bitching about the shortcomings of being human, I thought I\u2019d find out what we can do about it and that\u2019s how I came to write A Mindfulness Guide for the Frazzled.</p> <p>Frazzled shouldn\u2019t be confused with stress. We need stress \u2013 otherwise no oomph, and no oomph means no civilisation. We never would have stood up on two legs without it \u2013still an impossible feat in six-inch heels. Frazzled is a whole new thing: being stressed about being stressed, usually for something we\u2019ve manufactured in our heads. Unanswerable concepts, like: \u201cWhy am I a failure?\u201d Not even Einstein had an answer to that one. </p> <p>I personally wanted to learn how to de-frazzle and, even more urgently, find a method to defuse my depression. After much research, I found out mindfulness and cognitive therapy (called <a href=\"http://mbct.co.uk/\">MBCT</a>) had the best results, as far as empirical evidence goes, in dealing with stress, depression and anxiety. The word mindfulness gives me the same vibes as dream-catchers and lentils, but Oxford University offers a master\u2019s programme in MBCT so I thought there must be something to it. So I took the course, wrote my dissertation, spun it with comedy and boom, then got a book and show out of it. That\u2019s killing multiple birds with one stone.</p> <p>In my book I present my own six-week mindfulness course with the blessing of Mark Williams, my professor at Oxford and co-creator of MBCT. With my programme you don\u2019t have to perch on a gluten-free cushion, you can do the exercises anywhere, anytime; in the gym while pumping the pecs, or while eating a chocolate-chip cookie (or both at the same time).</p> <p>Even if you don\u2019t like the \u201cM-word\u201d, the practice gives you the skill of focusing your attention where you want it focused. When you are surrounded by constant distractions, as we all are these days, that\u2019s a gift; attention is our most precious commodity, yet it is the very thing we give away most freely. I think of mindfulness as getting on a bucking bronco and bringing it to tranquility by pulling in the reins gently. If you jerk them, the horse will tear your armpits \u2013 but, if you give it a quiet pat, the horse will eventually cool down and obey you. We know how to reboot our computers when they overload and we need to learn how to reboot our minds when they near their tipping point.</p> <p>I discuss using mindfulness with your children, teaching it in schools, using it in business. This is the only way I know to be able to navigate the noise and, as a bonus, be able to visit the present \u2013 a very rare destination. If you think being present sounds fluffy, ask yourself how much money you spend trying to get there? If you can sit back and enjoy the ride rather than racing to reach the finish line fastest, that is my definition of happiness. The rarest commodity of them all. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <h2>Extract</h2> <blockquote> <p>When you use mindfulness, you learn to accept things the way they are without trying to change them. It is the gateway to the \u2018shit happens\u2019 school of enlightenment. Everyone wants things to be better, but they mostly aren\u2019t, so what are you going to do about it? Have a hissy fit? This is a hard one to swallow, but swallow it you must if you want to go to sleep at night. As the observer, you witness the good, the bad and the ugly without giving a running commentary on whether you like what you\u2019re seeing or not. Once you start doing that, you\u2019ve lost your seat on the sidelines and will be sucked back into the crossfire of words.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a little metaphor to help you understand your thoughts. Picture your mind as a bottle of clear water with sand at the bottom. When it\u2019s agitated by thoughts or feelings, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve shaken the bottle: the sand disperses and the water is now murky. When you hold the bottle still, the sand settles, just as your mind settles when you watch thoughts rather than reacting to them. As I said, you can\u2019t think your way out of an emotional problem; the effort it takes to find out why you feel the way you feel always makes things worse. It\u2019s like being trapped in quicksand: the more you struggle to get out of it, the deeper you sink. You have to accept that you can\u2019t stop the thoughts, but you can stop what happens next.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More about the book</h2> <p>\u201cIt is impossible to deny her enthusiasm and personal trauma, her will to be well and compassion for fellow sufferers.\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/books/article1650449.ece\">Helen Davies, Sunday Times (paywall)</a></p> <h2>Buy the book</h2> <p>A Mindfulness Guide for the Frazzled by Ruby Wax is published by Penguin at \u00a38.99 and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/mindfulness-guide-for-the-frazzled-460141.html\">is available from the Guardian Bookshop for \u00a36.99</a>.

Until recently, the sector has made a great deal of money out of older people living in residential care homes. It\u2019s relied predominantly on local authorities to pay costs with annual increases in fees the norm.

I\u2019ve seen wastage in the NHS and across social care. And it\u2019s often around how we enable people to do their best work. We need to allow everyone to take more risks, show their initiative and help older people to continue to participate in their daily lives. That\u2019s really living and guess what?

Five years later, Kibble would be at the centre of an annus mirabilis in the department.</p> <p>In the summer of 1964, with two American colleagues, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/us/gerald-guralnik-77-a-god-particle-pioneer-dies.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Gerald Guralnik</a> and Richard Hagen, Kibble wrote the paper that demonstrated how particles that transmit nature\u2019s fundamental forces, and which on general theoretical principles should be massless, can nonetheless gain mass. The basic principle that underpins this mass mechanism is that nature prefers stability to symmetry. Thus, although the patterns or symmetries of mathematical equations call for particles without mass, this is unstable in a technical sense; nature\u2019s more stable state arises when the particles are massive. That October, their work was published in Physical Review Letters, which in 2008 selected it as \u201cone of the [journal\u2019s] most important papers of the past 50 years\u201d.</p> <p>Unfortunately, their idea had been independently discovered earlier that summer, not once, but twice, first by <a href=\"http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/46542\" title=\"\">Robert Brout</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/englert-facts.html\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Englert</a>, in Belgium, and also by Higgs. Higgs alone drew attention to a crucial implication of the mechanism: the existence of a novel particle, known as the \u201cHiggs boson\u201d. It was the experimental <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/04/higgs-boson-cern-scientists-discover\" title=\"\">discovery of the boson</a> 48 years later, in 2012, that paved the way for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/08/nobel-prize-physics-peter-higgs-boson-francois-englert\" title=\"\">recognition of these events by the Nobel foundation</a>.</p> <p>At the time, the mass mechanism was a theoretical gem, but with no clear application: the only certain candidate particle, the photon, which transmits the electromagnetic force, being empirically massless. That same summer, Salam developed a model of the weak force, which is responsible for a form of radioactivity and controls the rate that the sun uses its basic fuel. In Salam\u2019s construct, the weak force is transmitted by an analogue of the photon \u2013 the \u201cW boson\u201d \u2013 which, crucially, had to be massive. Had Salam and Kibble combined their ideas, they would have completed the established theory of the weak force and shared a Nobel prize. However, this did not happen and their respective ideas were largely ignored for three years.</p> <p>The seeds of the current standard model of particles and forces were sown in 1967 when Kibble made his unique observation, which showed how these mathematical concepts apply to the real world. Kibble demonstrated how the mechanism gives mass preferentially, and, critically, leaves the photon massless. His breakthrough proved an epiphany for <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/salam-facts.html\" title=\"\">Salam</a> and also for the American theorist <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/weinberg-facts.html\" title=\"\">Steven Weinberg</a>.</p> <p>Salam forever referred to the Higgs-Kibble mechanism in recognition of its practical application; Weinberg gave prominence to Kibble\u2019s breakthrough when he applied it to build the modern theory of the weak force. The resulting \u201cWeinberg-Salam model\u201d led to the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/\" title=\"\">Nobel physics prize in 1979</a>, which the duo shared with <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/glashow-facts.html\" title=\"\">Sheldon Glashow</a>, not Kibble.</p> <p>The ideas in Kibble\u2019s 1967 paper were also keys to the mathematical proof by <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1999/thooft-bio.html\" title=\"\">Gerard \u2019t Hooft</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1999/veltman-facts.html\" title=\"\">Martinus Veltman</a> that the above model is in fact a viable theory of the weak and electromagnetic forces. The <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1999/\" title=\"\">Nobel prize of 1999</a> recognised the work of \u2019t Hooft and Veltman.</p> <p>By 2013, and following discovery of the eponymous Higgs boson, there was general agreement that the Nobel prize for physics would be awarded to Higgs, and much speculation about who the other (up to two) recipients would be. The two living worthy theoreticians were Kibble \u2013 who had already been midwife to two Nobel prizes \u2013 and Englert (Brout having died in 2011). While the decision for the Nobel committee was bound to generate controversy \u2013 at most three can share an award \u2013 uniformly Kibble\u2019s role as a worthy contender was agreed. When the prize announcement was delayed for more than a hour, there was speculation that Kibble, a man of extraordinary modesty and humility, had been offered the award but declined. But the committee had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/08/nobel-prize-in-physics-live-blog\" title=\"\">awarded the prize to Higgs and Englert </a>and, by leaving a third option empty, implicitly recognised Brout.</p> <p>Throughout his career, Kibble was intrigued by the nature of symmetry, and its breaking, in particular when a physical system undergoes a change of phase (such as from vapour to liquid, or when a system freezes). The \u201cKibble-Zurek mechanism\u201d has application to the appearance of vortices in liquid helium and \u2013 Kibble\u2019s forte \u2013 to the formation of clusters of galaxies from fluctuations of density in the hot big bang. Here Kibble predicted the existence of \u201ccosmic strings\u201d, discontinuities in space and time, which could be detected by a characteristic refraction of light. Tantalising claims for such signals have been made. Were they to be confirmed, this would add another work of Nobel quality to Kibble\u2019s oeuvre.</p> <p>Among many honours, he was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1980 and won their Hughes medal. He won the Rutherford and Guthrie medals of the Institute of Physics, and the Albert Einstein medal from the Einstein Society in Bern. He was appointed CBE in 1998 and knighted in 2014.</p> <p>Kibble\u2019s wife, Anne (nee Allan), whom he married in 1957, died in 2005. He is survived by their son, Robert, and two daughters, Helen and Alison.</p> <p>\u2022 Thomas Walter Bannerman Kibble, physicist, born 23 December 1932; died 2 June 2016</p>",

          "body": "<p>Paul Dirac had an eye for beauty. In one essay, from May 1963, the British Nobel laureate referred to beauty nine times. It makes four appearances in four consecutive sentences. In the article he painted a picture of how physicists saw nature. But the word beauty never defined a sunset, nor a flower, or nature in any traditional sense. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/apr/02/paul-dirac-strangest-man-farmelo-quantum\">Dirac</a> was talking quantum theory and gravity. The beauty lay in the mathematics.<br /></p> <p>What does it mean for maths to be beautiful? It is not about the appearance of the symbols on the page. That, at best, is secondary. Maths becomes beautiful through the power and elegance of its arguments and formulae; through the bridges it builds between previously unconnected worlds. When it surprises. For those who learn the language, maths has the same capacity for beauty as art, music, a full blanket of stars on the darkest night.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe slow movement of the Mozart clarinet concerto is a really beautiful piece of music, but I don\u2019t print off a page of the score and put that on my wall. It\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about the music and the ideas and the emotional response,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/nov/26/solving-for-xmas-how-to-make-mathematical-christmas-cards\">Vicky Neale</a>, a mathematician at Oxford University. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with a piece of mathematics. It\u2019s not how it looks, it\u2018s about the underlying thought processes.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Brain scans of mathematicians show that gazing at formulae considered beautiful by the beholder elicits activity in the same emotional region as great art and music. The more beautiful the formula, the greater the activity in the medial orbito-frontal cortex. \u201cSo far as the brain is concerned, maths has beauty just like art. There is common neurophysiological ground,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/apr/21/highereducation.uk\">Sir Michael Atiyah</a>, an honorary professor of mathematics at Edinburgh University.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-alt=\"video-2\"> </figure>  <p>Ask mathematicians about the most beautiful equation and one crops up time and again. Written in the 18th century by the Swiss mathematician, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2013/apr/15/history-science\">Leonhard Euler</a>, the relation is short and simple: e<sup>i\u03c0</sup>+1 = 0. It is neat and compact even to the naive eye. But the beauty comes from a deeper understanding: here the five most important mathematical constants are brought together. Euler\u2019s formula marries the world of circles, imaginary numbers and exponentials.<br /></p> <p>The beauty of other formulae may be more obvious. With E=mc<sup>2</sup>, Albert Einstein built a bridge between energy and mass, two concepts that had previously seemed worlds apart. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/21/maggie-aderin-pocock-interview-bbc-nasa-space\">Maggie Aderin-Pocock</a>, the space scientist, declared it the most beautiful equation and she is in good company. \u201cWhy is it so beautiful? Because it comes to life. Now energy will have mass and mass can be put into energy. These four symbols capture a complete world. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a shorter formula with more power,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2014/jul/07/science-weekly-podcast-robbert-dijkgraaf-where-great-minds-think\">Robbert Dijkgraaf</a>, director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where Einstein was one of the first faculty members.<br /></p> <p>\u201cOne of the reasons there\u2019s almost an objective beauty in mathematics is that we use the word beautiful also to indicate the raw power in an idea. The equations or results in mathematics that are seen to be beautiful are almost like poems.The power per variable is something that is part of the experience. Just seeing a huge part of mathematics or nature being described with just a few symbols gives a great sense of elegance or beauty,\u201d Dijkgraaf adds. \u201cA second element is you feel its beauty is reflecting reality. It\u2019s reflecting a sense of order that\u2019s out there as part of the laws of nature.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-alt=\"video-1\"> </figure>  <p>The power of an equation to connect what seem like completely unrelated realms of mathematics comes up often. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marcus-du-sautoy\">Marcus du Sautoy</a>, a maths professor at Oxford, has more than a soft spot for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/nov/03/million-dollars-maths-riemann-hypothesis\">Riemann\u2019s formula</a>. Published by Bernhard Riemann in 1859 (the same year Charles Darwin stunned the world with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/10/on-the-origin-of-species-voted-most-influential-academic-book-charles-darwin\">On the Origin of Species</a>), the formula reveals how many primes exist below a given number, where primes are whole numbers divisible only by themselves and one, such as 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. While one side of the equation describes the primes, the other is controlled by zeros. </p> <p>\u201cThis formula turns these these indivisible prime numbers, into something completely different,\u201d says du Sautoy. \u201cOn the one side, you\u2019ve got these indivisible prime numbers and then Riemann takes you on this journey to somewhere completely unexpected, to these things which we now call the Riemann zeros. Each of these zeros gives rise to a note \u2013 and it\u2019s the combination of these notes together which tell us how the primes on the other side are distributed across all numbers.\u201d </p> <p>More than 2,000 years ago, the ancient Greek mathematician, Euclid, solved a numerical puzzle so beautifully that it still makes Neale smile every time it comes to mind. \u201cWhen I think about beauty in mathematics, my first thoughts are not about equations. For me it\u2019s much more about an argument, a line of thinking, or a particular proof,\u201d she says.<br /></p> <p>Euclid proved there are infinitely many prime numbers. How did he do it? He began by imagining a universe where the number of primes was not infinite. Given a big enough blackboard, one could chalk them all up.<br /></p> <p>He then asked what happened if all these primes were multiplied together: 2 x 3 x 5 and so on, all the way to the end of the list, and the result added to the number 1. This huge new number provides the answer. Either it is a prime number itself, and so the original list was incomplete, or it is divisible by a smaller prime. But divide Euclid\u2019s number by any prime on the list and always there is a 1 left over. The number is not divisible by any prime on the list. \u201cIt turns out you reach an absurdity, a contradiction,\u201d says Neale. The original assumption that the number of primes is finite must be wrong.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe proof for me is really beautiful. It takes some thinking to get your head around it, but it doesn\u2019t involve learning lots of difficult concepts. It\u2019s surprising that you can prove something so difficult in such an elegant way,\u201d Neale adds.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-alt=\"video-3\"> </figure>  <p>Behind beautiful processes lie beautiful mathematics. Well, some of the time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/19/hannah-fry-interview-maths\">Hannah Fry</a>, a lecturer in the mathematics of cities at UCL spent years staring at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/dec/14/million-dollars-maths-navier-stokes\">Navier-Stokes equations</a>. \u201cThey\u2019re a single mathematical sentence that is capable of describing the miraculously beautiful and diverse behaviour of almost all of Earth\u2019s fluids,\u201d she says. With a grasp of the formulae, we can understand blood flow in the body, make boats glide through the water, and build awesome chocolate enrobers.<br /></p> <p>In his 1963 essay, Dirac elevated beauty from an aesthetic response to something far more profound: a route to the truth. \u201cIt is more important to have beauty in one\u2019s equations than to have them fit experiment,\u201d he wrote, continuing: \u201cIt seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in one\u2019s equations, and if one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line of progress.\u201d Shocking at first pass, Dirac captured what is now a common sentiment: when a beautiful equation seems at odds with nature, the fault may lie not with the maths, but in applying it to the wrong aspect of nature.<br /></p> <p>\u201cTruth and beauty are closely related but not the same,\u201d says Atiyah. \u201cYou are never sure that you have the truth. All you are doing is striving towards better and better truths and the light that guides you is beauty. Beauty is the torch you hold up and follow in the belief that it will lead you to truth in the end.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/seat/maths/boot.js\" data-alt=\"quiz\"> </figure>  <p>Something approaching faith in mathematical beauty has led physicists to draw up two of the most compelling descriptions of reality: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2013/mar/14/supersymmetry-spell\">supersymmetry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/16/has-physics-gone-too-far\">string theory</a>. In a supersymmetric universe, every known type of particle has a heavier, invisible twin. In string theory, reality has 10 dimensions, but six are curled up so tight they are hidden from us. The mathematics behind both theories are often described as beautiful, but it is not at all clear if either is true.<br /></p> <p>There is a danger here for mathematicians. Beauty is a fallible guide. \u201cYou can literally be seduced by something that is not correct. This is a risk,\u201d says Dijkgraaf, whose institute motto, \u201cTruth and Beauty\u201d features one naked and one dressed woman. \u201cSometimes I feel that physicists, like Odysseus, must tie themselves to the mast of the ship so they are not seduced by the sirens of mathematics.\u201d<br /></p> <p>It may be that mathematicians and scientists are the only groups that still use the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d without hesitation. It is rarely employed by critics of literature, art or music, who perhaps fear it sounds superficial or kitschy.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud that in mathematics and science the concept of beauty is still there. I think it\u2019s an incredibly important concept in our lives,\u201d says Dijkgraaf. \u201cThe sense of beauty we experience in maths and science is a multidimensional sense of beauty. We don\u2019t feel it\u2019s in any conflict with being deep, or interesting, or powerful, or meaningful. For the mathematician it\u2019s all captured by that one word.\u201d</p>",

This was the fourth year of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/16/badger-cull-kills-more-than-10000-animals-three-months-bovine-tb\">culling badgers</a> but, in truth, we have been slaughtering our largest wild carnivore for decades. We have to ask one question: why has this bloody killing gone on for so long?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/16/badger-cull-kills-more-than-10000-animals-three-months-bovine-tb\">Badger cull kills more than 10,000 animals in three months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I use the b-word more as an adjective than an intensifier, since the blood of the innocents continues to be spilt. Scientists dislike value judgments such as \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cguilty\u201d. But even if the badger was \u201cguilty\u201d of spreading bovine TB to cattle, it would be an innocent victim of man\u2019s arrogance and blind stupidity.</p> <p>More than 30 years ago, while working for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature\">World Wildlife Fund</a>, I was asked to write a book about badgers and bovine TB. <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/2988189/the_fate_of_the_badger_the_great_badger_scapegoating_conspiracy.html\">The Fate of the Badger</a> was published in 1986. I never thought the controversy over controlling the bovine TB in cattle by killing a protected wild animal would become such a tortuous saga. Astonishingly, in the three decades since then, nothing much has changed.</p> <p>Thirty years ago we aimed to fight the official slaughter of a protected species through government-led badger culls by science not emotion. Then we met politics.</p> <p>For three years I was an adviser to the government \u2013 a depressing experience. I had a mole in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food_(United_Kingdom)\">Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries</a> (now Defra). He told me that the decision to cull badgers was taken at No 10. My staunchest ally at that time was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/02/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\">the great Phil Drabble</a>, the countryman and presenter of One Man and His Dog. He would phone me with a stream of unprintable invective against the department. Apart from being a TV celebrity, he wrote for The Field magazine and had a direct line of communication with our opponents. Where is his equivalent today?</p> <p>Politicians rise because they are clever, but few are blessed with a scientific mind. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/bovine-tb-not-passed-on-through-direct-contact-with-badgers-research-shows\">myth of badger culpability</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/bovine-tuberculosis\">bovine TB in cattle</a> is rooted in poor science \u2013 and economics.</p> <p>First, the science. This year, I wrote an updated edition of The Fate of the Badger. I concluded by remarking on the size of the <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em> bacillum \u2013 the cause of bovine TB. At 3-4 <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/microns\">microns</a>, many thousands could fit on this full stop. Even at 300,000 bacilli per millilitre, it has been estimated that a cow would need to drink three millilitres of badger urine to obtain an infective dose. Thus the size of a badger is irrelevant and many other scapegoats wait in the wings \u2013 deer, dogs, cats, pigs, sheep and alpacas all also carry bovine TB.</p> <p>What is not irrelevant is the mode of transmission or locus of infection: is an animal suffering pulmonary (located in the lungs and caused by inhalation of the bacilli) or extra-pulmonary (elsewhere in the body) TB? Cows tend to get the former. It has been <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hN4nii9Fba8C&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%27The+guilty+secret+of+kissing+cows%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UV0yMDFnGo&amp;sig=qAm8sF_dIze3larKt7mL-GnE-js&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ-pm3pYDRAhXJLsAKHSWmDy4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&apos;The%20guilty%20secret%20of%20kissing%20cows&apos;&amp;f=false\">known since the 1980s that \u201ckissing cows\u201d</a> \u2013 nuzzling each other over fences \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/05/bovine-tb-not-passed-on-through-direct-contact-with-badgers-research-shows\">the principal route of transmission</a>, so why this fixation on badgers? <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/lung/tc/tuberculosis-tb-topic-overview\">Extra-pulmonary TB</a> occasionally affects badgers and is caused by bite wounds affecting the neck. It is much less infectious than pulmonary TB.</p> <p>Second, the economics. The economic rationale for culling badgers is bound up with the question: who controls the countryside? Just <a href=\"http://www.countrylife.co.uk/articles/who-really-owns-britain-20219\">36,000 individuals</a> own half of rural land in England and Wales. These big landowners are members of the Country Land and Business Association and the National Farmers Union (NFU). And Defra and the NFU are bosom buddies: next door neighbours in Smith Square, London.</p> <p>Modern farming is a business and there is little space for sentiment in business. The NFU is inordinately powerful, yet most farmers are pretty ignorant about life beyond the farm gate. Most have no conception of epidemiology or biological processes yet, as a force, they are loud and intimidatory, even behind the collars and ties of the NFU.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/26/badger-cull-bovine-tuberculosis-tb\">The extension of the badger cull is horribly cruel \u2013 and it won\u2019t help farmers | Brian May </a> </p> </aside>  <p>But if farmers were better businessmen, they\u2019d rumble the NFU propaganda they\u2019ve been fed for so long and direct their ire at the politicians, not a defenceless, harmless wild animal that just happens to be big and noticeable.</p> <p>The bloody killing continues because of politics. The badger cull is an intellectual heirloom. So much has been invested in a catastrophic fallacy borne of political expediency that there is no way for the government now to save face: no hiding place despite all its exit strategies.</p> <p>Continuing to cull badgers to demonstrate their commitment to tackling bovine TB, ministers cannot \u2013 dare not \u2013 admit that original fatal error. As Albert Einstein remarked: \u201cInsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\u201d The trouble is, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727494/Why-I-walked-out-on-Robin-Day.html\">as Robin Day noted</a> during the Falklands war, politicians are \u201chere today, gone tomorrow\u201d. Cows continue to die of bovine TB and innocent badgers continued to be killed because politicians are the ultimate short-term animal.</p>",
